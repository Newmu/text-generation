S'Strike Me Lucky is a 1961 novel written by Jon Cleary in collaboration with his wife Joy. The plot concerns an Australian family who discover gold and the effect this has on their small town. Cleary originally wrote it as a short story for the Saturday Evening Post. Later while the Clearys were living in Spain, Joy was at a loose end and decided to adapt the story into a novel, which Jon then rewrote. It was published under her name and enjoyed minor success.[1] Marlon Brando optioned the film rights for his production company Pennebaker, intending to make it as a co-production in England, but no movie was made.[2][3] However Jon Cleary did later adapt it into a play in 1969.[4]'

aS'Animal Fairy Tales is a collection of short stories written by L. Frank Baum, the creator of the Land of Oz series of children\'s books. The stories (animal tales, comparable to Aesop\'s Fables or the Just-So Stories and Jungle Book of Rudyard Kipling) first received magazine publication in 1905. For several decades in the twentieth century, the collection was a "lost" book by Baum; it resurfaced when the International Wizard of Oz Club published the stories in one volume in 1969.[1] The nine stories in the collection were printed in consecutive monthly issues of The Delineator (a popular women\'s magazine of the time) from January to September 1905. The tales were part of the magazine\'s regular feature, "Stories and Pastimes for Children", and primarily illustrated by Charles Livingston Bull;[2] The Delineator published Baum\'s story "A Kidnapped Santa Claus" in December 1904 with illustrations by Frederick Richardson, who had begun illustrating Baum\'s serialized novel Queen Zixi of Ix the previous month in St. Nicholas. Baum favored book publication for the stories; when his health declined in 1918, he worked to prepare books for future publication in the event of his death. Baum readied three manuscripts, so his publisher (Reilly & Britton) could issue annual Baum books through 1921. Two of those books were the last two in his Oz series (The Magic of Oz and Glinda of Oz), which were published in 1919 and 1920; the third book was Animal Fairy Tales.[3] It is unknown why Reilly & Britton did not publish the latter. The collection consists of: Of the stories, "The Enchanted Buffalo" is the most-frequently anthologized.[4] The stories were probably written in 1903 and 1904; they resemble other animal tales that Baum wrote during the same period, some of which appeared in his American Fairy Tales (1901), The Twinkle Tales (1906) and as episodes in his novels.[5] Baum\'s animal tales employ his highly-imaginative style (influenced by his interest in theosophy), and differ from the more-naturalistic tales of contemporaries such as Albert Bigelow Paine. In "The Story of Jaglon," for example, an orphaned tiger is raised by "tiger fairies." In 1953, Oz author Jack Snow\'s expansion of this story (entitled Jaglon and the Tiger Fairies) was published with illustrations by Dale Ulrey. This was the first in a series of expanded versions of all nine stories planned by Reilly & Lee, but the other eight were never published. Baum wrote another story for the collection; entitled "The Tiger\'s Eye", it is a grim, harsh story about evil magic enchanting animals and men which was not printed until 1962. Another edition of Animal Fairy Tales, including the original illustrations by Charles Bull, appeared in 1992.[6]'

aS"New Andalusia Governorate was one of the governorates of the Spanish Empire. It was created as one of King Charles V's grants of 1534, establishing the adelantado Pedro de Mendoza as its first governor, captain general, and chief justice. The territory was described as extending 200 leagues down the Pacific coast from Diego de Almagro's grant of New Toledo, but was understood to involve the exploration, pacification, and settlement of the Ro de la Plata along the Atlantic. While this province in theory included all of modern Uruguay and Paraguay and large segments of Chile, Argentina and Brazil, the adelantados were only able to effectively colonize the Paran River, losing other territories to subsequent grants. After the establishment of the Viceroyalty of Peru, it was replaced by the Governorate of the Ro de la Plata under the supervision of the Audience of Lima. "

aS'Strasburg-Franklin High School is a public high school in Strasburg, Ohio. It is the only high school in the Strasburg-Franklin Local School District. Their nickname is the Tigers. The first public school in Strasburg was constructed in 1881 at a cost of $5000 ,[2] and was located on South Wooster Avenue. This building has since been demolished and the current buildings reside at 140 N Bodmer Avenue. The first school building in the current location was built in 1912. A new high school was finished in 1939 some yards to the north of the old building. In 1957, two additions were opened, one linking the existing buildings, and the other housing new classrooms on the south end of the 1912 building. The older building houses K-6, a small gymnasium, and elementary school offices. The 1939 building houses 8-12. The connecting addition houses school district administrators, high school principal, a gymnasium, cafeteria, band rooms, industrial education, and art facilities. All these buildings are to be demolished by 2012. State and local funding was appropriated to construct new buildings just west of the old buildings. The first building opened in 2007. The second building, housing the high school and connected to the first building, opened in 2010[3] using funds from the Tobacco_Master_Settlement_Agreement.[4] Local boosters are raising funds to finish athletic and other facilities prohibited by state law from using state funding to construct.'

aS'The romance (the term is Spanish, and is pronounced accordingly: Spanish pronunciation:[romane]) is a metric combination that originated in the verse and poetry of Spain.[1] It consists of an indefinite series (tirada) of verses, in which the even-numbered lines have a near-rhyme (assonance) and the odd lines are unrhymed.[1][2] The lines are octosyllabic (eight syllables to a line);[1][3] a similar but far less common form is hexasyllabic (six syllables to a line) and is known in Spanish as romancillo (a diminutive of romance);[1] that, or any other form of less than eight syllables may also be referred to as romance corto ("short romance").[3][4] A similar form in alexandrines (12 syllables) also exists, but is traditionally used in Spanish only for clerical poetry.[1] Poems in the romance form may be as few as ten verses long, and may extend to over 1,000 verses. They may constitute either epics or erudite romances juglarescos (from the Spanish word whose modern meaning is "juggler"; compare the French jongleur, which can also refer to a minstrel as well as a juggler). The epic forms trace back to the cantares de gesta (the Spanish equivalent of the French chansons de geste) and the lyric forms to the Provenal pastorela.'

It was formed in 1992, situated on the Twelve Quays site in Birkenhead from 1998-2013, overlooking the River Mersey and in June 2013 the institute relocated to the Liverpool Science Park in Liverpool.[1][2] The institute is in the top 1% of institutions in the field of space science as measured by total citations.[3] There are currently over 60 staff members and research students working at the institute, which lies within the administration of the Liverpool John Moores University\'s Faculty of Science.[4] Conducted research varies into many areas of astronomy and astrophysics, such as supernovae, star formation and galaxy clusters with publications of work in scientific journals. Research is funded by external organisations, such as the Science and Technology Facilities Council,[5] and the Higher Education Funding Council for England.[6] The institute research is conducted with the aid of the university Liverpool Telescope which is located on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands.[7] The institute currently teaches two undergraduate courses: a three BSc. (Hons) in Physics and Astronomy, as well as a 4 year MPhys. (Hons) in Astrophysics. Postgraduate courses are also made available at Ph.D level. Both the undergraduate courses are taught as a joint degree by the Astrophysics Research Instiute of Liverpool John Moores University, and the Department of Physics at the University of Liverpool. The courses are also accredited by the Institute of Physics. Courses are also made available to those who do not have a scienctific or mathematical background. The Astronomy by Distance Learning courses are taught by CD-ROM, DVD and website material without the need for classroom sessions. Each of the 10 courses provides an introduction into astronomy as well as specialist areas such as cosmology, eventually leading to potential certification . In 2006, the institute received the "Queen\'s Anniversary Prize" for higher education in recognition for its development of the robotic telescope.[8] In 2007 the "Times Higher Education Supplement Award" for \'project of the year\' was given for the use of RINGO optical polarimeter at the Liverpool Telescope in measuring gamma-ray bursts. RINGO has since been decommissioned and an updated polarimeter named RINGO2 is since in operation.[9] The current Director of the Astrophysics Research Institute is Professor Mike Bode, who has served as a past Vice-President and Secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society.

aS"Saint Livinus (c. 580  12 November 657), also Livinus of Ghent, was an apostle in Flanders and Brabant, venerated as a saint and martyr in Catholic tradition and more especially at the Saint Bavo Chapel, Ghent.[1] His feast day is 12 November. Details of the biography of Deventer saint Lebuinus were used to compile the Passio of St Livinus.[1] The legend goes that Livinus was born from Irish nobility. Upon studies in England, where he visited Saint Augustine of Canterbury, he returned to Ireland. He later went on a peregrinatio Domini and left Ireland for Ghent (Belgium) and Sealand (Netherlands) where he preached. During one of his sermons, Livinus was attacked in the village of Esse, near Geraardsbergen by a group of pagans who cut out his tongue and severed his head. The villages of Sint-Lievens-Esse, where he was murdered, and Sint-Lievens-Houtem, where he was buried, were named after him. His remains were transferred to Ghent around the turn of the millennium, but went missing and are believed to have been destroyed in 1578 during the Second Iconoclasm. Recent research questions the existence of Saint Livinus.[1][2][3] There are resemblances between Saint Livinus and Saint Lebuinus of Deventer (Netherlands), an English missionary who died in Deventer c. 775 and who is commemorated on 12 November in the Utrecht diocese. Both figures were engaged in the christening of pagans in the Low Countries and were confronted with similar conflicts and clashes. It has been argued that monks of the Saint Bavo Abbey in Ghent, Livinus' presumed place of residence, have launched the cultus of Saint Livinus and found inspiration in the life of Saint Lebuinus."

He discussed threat levels of a possible attack by Al-Qaeda in 2004, as well as other topics.[5] On 23 August 2004, Pistole testified before Congress about changes the FBI made in response to the 9/11 Commission.[6] Pistole and Valerie E. Caproni were the two FBI officials who approved a memo laying out the FBI\'s policy on the limits to the interrogation of captives taken during the United States\' war on terror.[7] The memo was from the FBI\'s General Counsel, to all offices, explaining that FBI officials were not allowed to engage in coercive interrogations; FBI officials were not allowed to sit in on coercive interrogations conducted by third parties; FBI officials were required to immediately report any instances of suspected coercive interrogation up the FBI chain of command. Pistole served as Deputy Director of the FBI from October 2004 to May 2010. As Deputy Director, Pistole was second in command within the FBI and pivotally involved in the formation of terrorism policies. Pistole was nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration on 17 May 2010 and was unanimously confirmed to serve in that position by the United States Senate on 25 June 2010. On 16 November 2010 Pistole defended his agency\'s new extensive pat-down procedures and Advanced Imaging Technology (A.I.T) as necessary. On 21 November 2010, Pistole again justified the new search policies on CNN saying "We know through intelligence that there are determined people, terrorists who are trying to kill not only Americans but innocent people around the world."[8] On 21 November 2010, Pistole acknowledged new TSA screening procedures are "invasive" and "uncomfortable" but said they were necessary. Unfortunately, many questions raised by American citizens regarding this policy remain unanswered and Pistole has remained silent regarding significant constitutional objections. After a recent attempt by a TSA "VIPR" team in Savannah to search passengers disembarking from an Amtrak train, the TSA was banned from Amtrak property by Amtrak Police Chief John O\'Connor.[9]'

aS'Matthew Nile Ashford (born January 29, 1960) is an American actor best known for the long-running role of Jack Deveraux on the NBC soap opera Days of our Lives. Ashford, the sixth of eight children, was born in Davenport, Iowa, the son of Patricia, an executive secretary, and Cecil Ashford, a civil engineer.[1] He graduated with a B.F.A. in Theater from the North Carolina School of the Arts in Winston-Salem. Ashford has been married to singer-actress Christina Saffran Ashford since June 6, 1987. They have two daughters, Grace (born in 1992) and Emma (born in 1997). In 1997, four-month old Emma was diagnosed with a rare form of childhood eye cancer, Retinoblastoma. The disease was treated with surgeries to remove the maligant tumors in her eyes and chemotherapy. At the age of five, tumors recurred in Emma\'s left eye, and it was removed and replaced with a prosthetic. Ashford has been instrumental in raising funds and awareness for this disease. He is the spokesperson for the Retinoblastoma International Foundation. In May 2010, while on tour in Toronto, Canada, he obtained a US/Canada dual citizenship. Ashford\'s father was born in Canada, therefore making him and his siblings eligible to become Canadians, without relinquishing their American citizenship. After graduation, Ashford moved to New York City, where he was cast as Drew Ralston on One Life to Live, a role he played from 1982 to 1983. He also appeared on Search for Tomorrow as Cagney McCleary from 1984 to 1986, as Tom Hardy Sr. on General Hospital from 1995 to 1997, and the serial killer Dr. Stephen Haver on One Life to Live from 2003 to 2004 and also played Roger in WB hit series Charmed. He is best known for playing Jack Deveraux on the NBC soap opera, Days of our Lives. Ashford has had several stints playing Jack, a conflicted character who descended into darkness after raping the woman who married him in order to give him reason to fight his illness. After a lengthy struggle with his guilt over his dark deeds, Jack finally was able to get back on track and allow himself to love his soulmate Jennifer who pursued him relentlessly. Ashford\'s pairing with Melissa Reeves\' Jennifer was wildly popular (winning the 7th Soap Opera Digest award for favorite super couple) and the couple is considered a supercouple, by soap opera standards. Jack also became integrated into his biological family. Ashford\'s initial run was from 1987 to 1993. He returned from 2001 to 2003, but was written off as part of a controversial storyline where nearly a dozen residents of the fictional town of Salem appeared to have been murdered. (The complex plot had them alive and held hostage in another country.) He returned to the show in 2004, but had spent much of his time since on the back burner, and was off-screen for large portions of 2005 and 2006. In July 2006, it was announced that Ashford, a fan favorite, had again been let go from the Days of our Lives cast roster, a story confirmed in the July 25, 2006 edition of industry magazine Soap Opera Digest. Ashford\'s last day on Days of our Lives was on September 21, 2006. Jack and Jennifer bid Salem farewell as they headed off, young son in tow, to live and work in London. Ashford made a brief appearance as Jack in April 2007, and in September 2011 returned to the show on a full-time basis, only to be fired again in April 2012. Jack dies in an elevator crash, after saving his daughter Abigail, who was trapped. As Abigail gets out and goes to her mother, Jennifer and Abigail\'s boyfriend, Cameron, try to save Jack, but the elevator doors close and the cords break causing the elevator to crash to the ground and kill Jack. Ashford is part of a production company (NGM Productions). They have just produced a movie entitled The Unlikeleys. In it, Ashford plays the most famous soap star in the world and his exact look-alike. Ashford\'s production company has also produced a movie entitled The Exorcism of Tina Miller, and they are currently working on the distribution details. Ashford also appeared with Scott Bakula in a production of \'No Strings\' in May 2007. From February to June 2010, he played \'Bill" in the North American tour of Mamma Mia!. The final performances were cut short due to security concerns with the G20 Summit in Toronto, Canada. The summit location was two blocks away from the theatre. Currently, he is playing Steve Jenson on the soap web series "The Bay", along with his former Days of Our Lives co-star, Mary Beth Evans. In 2012, Ashford was recruited by the Outside the Box Musical Theatre Company for a new musical based on a Clint Eastwood movie.'

aS'Madona (pronunciation(helpinfo); German: Madohn) is a town with town rights in the Vidzeme region of Latvia and is the center of the Madona municipality. The surrounding area of Madona had been populated in earlier times, which is confirmed by discoveries of old burial grounds in the city\'s vicinity. Madona is first mentioned in writing in 1461, when Archbishop Sylvester began renting the lands of Biri Manor. However, the Swedish government placed the land under state control. After the Great Northern War, Madona became property of the Russian Empire. Empress Elizabeth presented Biri Manor along with other of Vidzeme\'s manors to Count Alexander Buturlin. Empress Catherine II bought the lands back as a present to another relative of her court  the Serbian major-general Maxim Zori. From the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century, the location of Madona was the fields of Biri Manor. According to one version, the name of Madona stems from the adjacent Madona Lake. According to another version, Madona got its name from Biri Manor, which German exonym is Madohn or Modohn. For this reason, the railway station situated at the Pavias - Valka narrow gauge railway line was named Madona as well. The populated place that slowly emerged around the station also got this name after the erection of the Madona railway station in 1903.[1] Village privileges was given to Madona 1 July 1921, and town privileges 7 June 1926. Since 1 April 1925 Madona was the center of the newly founded Madona parish. Madona had 1,357 inhabitants at the time. The Latvian Central Statistics Department reported 9,242 citizens as of 1 January 2007, with 888 people per square kilometre (0.37 square miles).[citation needed] When it comes to age distribution of the Madona inhabitants, the majority group consisting of 5,925 people are registered as "labour-capable" (Latvian: darbaspjgie); 1,339 are under the age of "labour-capability" and 1867 are over. As of 21 December 2007, there are 211 (3.5%) unemployed citizens of the labour force.[2] The town of Madona lies in hilly surroundings, that descents underneath the town in a northwestern-southeastern direction. Several minor rivers and streams flows through the town, such as: Lisa River, Leivrte, Ridzte, Mucenieki River, Rieba River and Madona River  which flows can be seen in beautiful glens, like: The Love Glen, The Wedding Glen and The Divorce Glen. In The Love Glen is a park, in which the manmade water reservoir has one of the highest fountains in Latvia. Madona is 170km from Latvian capital Riga, eastern direction.

aS'Anuup (Sanskrit: , IPA:[nuub]) is the name of a meter and a metrical unit, found in both Vedic and Classical Sanskrit poetry, but with significant differences. By origin, an anuup stanza is a quatrain of four lines. Each line, called a pda (lit. "foot") has eight syllables. Arnold distinguishes three varieties of anuubh in the Vedic corpus: an early free form, with very few restrictions except a general iambic (" -  +") tendency in the cadence (vtta) of each of the four pdas; e.g.  ys te sar | pirsute | - - - - | u - u - | gne m s | ti dhyase - - u - | u - u -  iu dyumnm | ut rvah | - - - u | u - u u |  cittm mr | tieu dhh  - - - - | u - u -  [1] next, a mildly trochaic development in the opening of each pda; and finally the development of the "epic Anuubh" (mostly in the Atharvaveda) prefiguring the classical loka form. Although in these hymns the iambic cadence of the first verse is still the most frequent (25%) of all varieties, it is already very nearly equaled (23%) by the normal and characteristic cadence of the first verse in the epic Anuhubh (loka), where the iambic cadence in the first verse has entirely disappeared.[1] In classical Sanskrit the anuubh developed into its specific epic form known as shloka, as described above, which may be considered the Indian verse par excellence, occurring, as it does, far more frequently than any other meter in classical Sanskrit poetry.[2] The epic anuubh (shloka) is treated as a couplet. Each hemistich of 16 syllables can take either a pathy ("normal") form or one of several vipul ("extended") forms. The metrical constraints on a hemistich in terms of its two constituent pdas are as follows:[3] Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first pda. By comparison, Syllables 5-7 of any pda in the old Vedic anuubh is typically a ja-gaa ("  "), or a dijambus. Vrttaratnaakara says the following:      // . //     // . //    // . //  // . //        // . //   // . //    // . //   // . //   // . //    // . // An example of an anuubh stanza which fails the classical requirements of a shloka is from the Shatapatha Brahmana'

aS'Atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) or Atomic Layer Chemical Vapor Deposition (ALCVD), now more generally called Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), is a specialized form of epitaxy that typically deposit alternating monolayers of two elements onto a substrate. The crystal lattice structure achieved is thin, uniform, and aligned with the structure of the substrate. The reactants are brought to the substrate as alternating pulses with "dead" times in between. ALE makes use of the fact that the incoming material is bound strongly until all sites available for chemisorption are occupied. The dead times are used to flush the excess material. It is mostly used in semiconductor fabrication to grow thin films of thickness of the atomic order. This technique was invented in 1970, then patented in 1977, by Dr. Tuomo Suntola, at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Dr. Suntola tried in fact to grow thin films of Zinc sulfide to fabricate electroluminescent flat panel displays. The main trick used for this technique is the use of a self-limiting chemical reaction to control in a very accurate way the thickness of the film deposited. Compared to basic chemical vapour deposition for example, chemical reactants are pulsed alternatively in a reaction chamber and then chemisorb on to the surface of the substrate in order to form the monolayer. This is very clever because the reaction is very easy to set up and it doesnt require that many restrictions over the reactants, allowing the use of a wide range of materials. ALD introduces two complementary precursors (e.g. Al(CH3)3 and H2O) alternatively into the reaction chamber. Typically, one of the precursors will adsorb onto the substrate surface until it saturates the surface and further growth cannot occur until the second precursor is introduced. Thus the film thickness is controlled by the number of precursor cycles rather than the deposition time as is the case for conventional CVD processes. ALD allows for extremely precise control of film thickness and uniformity.'

Before September 2005, these call letters were on the 92.1 frequency, broadcasting the Clear Channel KISS-FM brand of Top 40. Despite carrying the "KISSFM" brand name, KIZS was not always a Top 40 station. When 92-1 KISSFM launched, it was a Mainstream Top 40 station, competing with 106.9 KHITS. However, that format was not working in terms of ratings or revenue and the format was tweaked to an adult-leaning Top 40, described by some as a "90s and Now" Hot AC. After a year in this format and with the station still not garnering the success that Clear Channel would have liked, the format was once again tweaked, this time back toward Mainstream Top 40 in mid-2004, again with limited success. On September 23, 2005, KTBT moved from its 101.5 frequency to the much stronger 92.1 frequency in order to better compete with 106.9 KHITS. The format on the 101.5 frequency was then adjusted to the station Clear Channel Communications\'s current configuration, the "La Preciosia" brand featuring Spanish Oldies.

Cordia alliodora is one of several Cordia trees called bocote in Spanish and its wood, which has very little figure, is usually called freijo or jennywood along with that of Cordia goeldiana. The wood is used for boat decking, furniture, cabinetry and guitar/bass building luthiers and sometimes substitutes for mahogany or teak. Outside of its indigenous range, Cordia alliodora has been identified as a problematic invasive species. For example, a timber-focused planting program of the species in Vanuatu during the mid-1970s has over time proved disruptive to native ecosystems and communities. The species has been described as a severe environmental nuisance, as it has overtaken natural forests by multiplying at a faster rate than being harvested, and has become susceptible to outbreaks of a form of root rot known as Phellinus noxius.[3]'

aS"The Old Church of St Mary the Virgin, Preston Candover, is a redundant Anglican church in the village of Preston Candover, Hampshire, England. It has been designated by English Heritage as a GradeII* listed building,[1] and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.[2] Only the chancel of the church has survived. It is situated towards the south of the village, on the northwest side of the B3046 road.[2][3] The church was founded in about 1190.[2] It was damaged in a fire in 1681 and rebuilt. At this time it is thought that it consisted of a long single cell with transepts, and a western weatherboarded bellcote with a pyramidal roof. In 1831 the church was enlarged, providing 48additional sittings. By 1885 the fabric of the church had deteriorated so much that, except for the chancel, it was demolished. A new church with the same dedication was built nearer the centre of the village.[1] The building is open daily.[2] The chancel is constructed in flint with stone dressings and brick quoins. The roof is tiled. The west wall was added when the rest of the church was demolished and is in rubble. The building is almost square in plan. In the west wall is a round-headed doorway. The north wall contains a small lancet window dating from about 1190, and in the south wall is a two-light Perpendicular window and a blocked round-headed priest's door.[1] The east window is round-headed with a single light.[1][4] On the west gable is a wooden bellcote.[4] The floor contains some medieval tiles, and inscribed slabs and brasses dating from the 17th and 18thcenturies. On the north and south walls are four marble memorials dating between 1729 and 1798. On the west wall is a framed painting recording the 1831 expansion of the church and two boards bearing the Ten Commandments. On the east wall are wall paintings that probably date from the 18thcentury.[1][2] Also in the church is a small piscina, and altar rails dating from the 17thcentury.[1]"

aS"The Great Plague of Marseille was the last of the significant European outbreaks of bubonic plague. Arriving in Marseille, France in 1720, the disease killed 100,000 people in the city and the surrounding provinces.[1] However, Marseille recovered quickly from the plague outbreak. Economic activity took only a few years to recover, as trade expanded to the West Indies and Latin America. By 1765, the growing population was back at its pre-1720 level. This great outburst of plague was the last recurrence of an epidemic of bubonic plague, following the devastating episodes which began in the mid-fourteenth century with the European Black Death.[2] In 1720, the plague bacillus Yersinia pestis arrived at the port of Marseille from the Levant. The merchant ship, the Grand-Saint-Antoine, had departed from Sidon in Lebanon, having previously called at Smyrna, Tripoli, and plague-ridden Cyprus. Following the death on board of a Turkish passenger, several crew members fell victim to the plague, including the ship's surgeon. The ship was refused entry to the port of Livorno and, on arrival at Marseille, was promptly placed under quarantine in the lazaret by the port authorities.[3] Due largely to its monopoly on French trade with the Levant, this important port had a large stock of imported goods in warehouses and was actively expanding its trade with other areas of the Middle East and emerging markets in the New World. Powerful city merchants needed the silk and cotton cargo of the ship for the great medieval fair at Beaucaire and pressured authorities to lift the quarantine. A few days later, the disease broke out in the city. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed, and residents panicked, driving the sick from their homes and out of the city. Mass graves were dug but were quickly filled. Eventually the number of dead overcame city public health efforts, until thousands of corpses lay scattered and in piles around the city. Attempts to stop the spread of plague included an Act of the Parlement of Aix that levied the death penalty for any communication between Marseille and the rest of Provence. To enforce this separation, a plague wall, the Mur de la Peste, was erected across the countryside. The wall was built of dry stone, 2 m high and 70 cm thick, with guard posts set back from the wall. Remains of the wall can still be seen in different parts of the Plateau de Vaucluse. During a two-year period, 50,000 of Marseille's total population of 90,000 died, and an additional 50,000 people succumbed as the plague spread north, eventually reaching Aix-en-Provence, Arles, Apt and Toulon. Estimates indicate an overall death rate of between 25%-50% for the population in the larger area, with the city of Marseille at 40%, the area of Toulon at above 50%, and the area of Aix and Arles at 25%. After the plague subsided, the royal government strengthened the plague defenses of the port, building the waterside Lazaret d'Arenc. A double line of fifteen-foot walls ringed the whitewashed compound, pierced on the waterside to permit the offloading of cargo from lighters, once merchantmen had passed inspection at an island further out in the harbour, where crews and cargoes were examined.[4] In 1998, an excavation of a mass grave of victims of the bubonic plague outbreak was conducted by scholars from the Universit de la Mditerrane.[5] The excavation provided an opportunity to study more than 200 skeletons from an area in the second arrondissement in Marseille, known as the Monastery of the Observance. In addition to modern laboratory testing, archival records were studied to determine the conditions and dates surrounding the use of this mass grave. This multidisciplinary approach revealed previously unknown facts and insights concerning the epidemic of 1722. The reconstruction of the skull of one body, a 15-year-old boy, revealed the first historical evidence of an autopsy dated to the spring of 1722. The anatomic techniques used appear to be identical to those described in a surgical book dating from 1708. "

aS'Olof Peter Swartz (September 21, 1760  September 19, 1818) was a Swedish botanist and taxonomist. He is best known for his taxonomic work and studies into pteridophytes. He attended the University of Uppsala where he studied under Carolus Linnaeus the Younger and received his doctorate in 1781. He first traveled in 1780, to Lapland in the company of several other botanists.[1] In 1783 he sailed for North America and the West Indies, primarily in the area of Jamaica and Hispaniola, to collect botanical specimens.[2] His botanilcal collection, of an impressive 6000 specimens, is now held by the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as part of the Regnellian herbarium.[3] By 1786 he left for London to prepare his collection. There he met Joseph Banks, who was impressed with his knowledge of Botany. He was offered a position with the British East India Company as a travelling physician, but turned it down, and returned to Sweden in 1787. Ten years later he proposed to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (of which he became a member in 1789) the idea of a permanent travel grant, based on the methods he had seen employed by Banks within the British Empire. In 1791 he became Professor Bergianus at the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm.[4] Swartz was the first specialist of orchid taxonomy, who published a critical review of orchid literature and classified the 25 genera that he recognized through his own work. He was also the first to realize that most orchids have one stamen, while slipper orchids have two.[5] The genus Swartzia (Caesalpiniaceae, Fabaceae or Leguminosae) was named in his honor by Schreber.

aS'A qollqa is a storage structure found along the roads of the Inca Empire\'s road system.[1] The spelling of this word is varied: qolca, qollca, quolla, qolla, and other variations. Quollqas are distinct from the tambo, in that the tambo was meant for more than storage. There are many more quollqas than tambos. Each provincial center of the Empire had hunfreds of qollcas built row after row on nearby hills.[2] Some of qollcas built around Cusco also supplied local artisans and their products.[3] The largest number of qollcas, 2573 of them, was built in the Mantaro Valley.[2] Half of them were placed in the center of this grain-producing area, another half scattered among 48 compounds along the river.[2] In total, the Mantaro Valley qollcas have storage area of 170 thousand square meters, being the largest storage facility in pre-Columbian America.[2] Qollqa, i.e. granary, is the local name for the constellation Pleiades.[4] The Inca deity Qollqa, personified in the Pleiades, was the patron of warehousing and preserving seeds for the next season.[5] Of all the stellar pantheon worshipped by Incas, Qollqa was the "mother", the senior over all heavenly patrons of earthly things.[6] '

aS'Jacques Franois Antoine Ibert (15 August 1890 5 February 1962) was a French composer. Having studied music from an early age, he studied at the Paris Conservatoire and won its top prize, the Prix de Rome at his first attempt, despite studies interrupted by his service in World War I. Ibert pursued a successful composing career, writing (sometimes in collaboration with other composers) seven operas, five ballets, incidental music for plays and films, songs, choral works, and chamber music. He is probably best remembered for his orchestral works including Divertissement (1930) and Escales (1922). As a composer, Ibert did not attach himself to any of the prevalent genres of music of his time, and has been described as an eclectic. This is seen even in his best-known pieces: Divertissement, for small orchestra is lighthearted, even frivolous, and Escales (1922) is a ripely romantic work for large orchestra. In tandem with his creative work, Ibert was the director of the Acadmie de France at the Villa Medici in Rome. During World War II he was proscribed by the pro-Nazi government in Paris, and for a time he went into exile in Switzerland. Restored to his former eminence in French musical life after the war, his final musical appointment was in charge of the Paris Opera and the Opra-Comique. Ibert was born in Paris. His father was a successful businessman and his mother was a talented pianist who had studied with Antoine Franois Marmontel and encouraged the young Ibert\'s musical interests. From the age of four, he began studying music, first learning the violin and then the piano. After leaving school, he earned a living as a private teacher, as an accompanist, and as a cinema pianist. He also started composing songs, sometimes under the pen name William Berty. In 1910 he became a student at the Paris Conservatoire, studying with Emile Pessard (harmony), Andr Gedalge (counterpoint) and Paul Vidal (composition).[1] Gdalge also gave him private lessons in orchestration; Ibert\'s fellow-students at these private classes included Arthur Honegger and Darius Milhaud.[2] Ibert\'s musical studies were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, in which he served as a naval officer. After the war he married Rosette Veber, daughter of the painter Jean Veber. Resuming his studies, he won the Conservatoire\'s top prize, the Prix de Rome at his first attempt, in 1919.[2] The prize gave him the opportunity to pursue further musical studies in Rome. In the course of these, Ibert composed his first opera, Perse et Andromde (1921), to a libretto by his brother-in-law, the author Michel Veber, writing under the pen name "Nino".[3] Among Ibert\'s early orchestral compositions were La Ballade de la gele de Reading, inspired by Oscar Wilde\'s poem, and Escales (Ports of call), inspired by his experiences of Mediterranean ports while he was serving in the navy.[4] The first of these works was played at the Concerts Colonne in October 1922, conducted by Gabriel Piern; the second was performed in January 1924 with Paul Paray conducting the Orchestre Lamoureux. The two works made Ibert an early reputation both at home and abroad. His publisher Alphonse Leduc commissioned two collections of piano music from him, Histoires and Les Rencontres, which enhanced his popularity.[2] Rencontres. In 1927 his opra-bouffe Anglique was produced; it was the most successful of his operas, a musical farce, displaying eclectic style and flair.[3] In addition to composing, Ibert was active as a conductor and in musical administration. He was a member of professional committees, and in 1937 he was appointed director of the Acadmie de France at the Villa Medici in Rome. Ibert, with the enthusiastic support of his wife "threw himself wholeheartedly into his administrative role and proved an excellent ambassador of French culture in Italy."[2] He held the post until the end of 1960, except for an enforced break while France and Italy were at war during World War II. The war years were difficult for Ibert. In 1940 the Vichy government banned his music and he retreated to Antibes, in the south of France, and later to Switzerland and the Haute-Savoie. In August 1944, he was readmitted to the musical life of the country when General de Gaulle recalled him to Paris. In 1955 Ibert was appointed administrator of the Runion des Thtres Lyriques Nationaux, which ran both the Paris Opera and the Opra-Comique. After less than a year, his health obliged him to retire. Shortly afterwards he was elected to the Acadmie des Beaux-Arts.[2] Ibert died in Paris aged 71, and is buried at Passy Cemetery in the city\'s 16th arrondissement. Ibert refused to ally himself to any particular musical fashion or school, maintaining that "all systems are valid", a position that has caused many commentators to categorise him as "eclectic".[3] His biographer, Alexandra Laederich, writes, "His music can be festive and gay  lyrical and inspired, or descriptive and evocative  often tinged with gentle humour[A]ll the elements of his musical language bar that of harmony relate closely to the Classical tradition."[2] The early orchestral works, such as Escales, are in "a lush Impressionist style",[5] but Ibert is at least as well known for lighthearted, even frivolous, pieces, among which are the Divertissement for small orchestra and the Flute Concerto.[5] Ibert\'s stage works similarly embrace a wide variety of styles. His first opera, Perse et Andromde, is a concise, gently satirical piece. Anglique displays his "eclectic style and his accomplished writing of pastiche set pieces".[3] Le roi d\'Yvetot is written, in part in a simple folklike style. The opra bouffe Gonzague is another essay in the old opera bouffe style. L\'Aiglon, composed jointly with Honegger, employs commedia dell\'arte characters and much musical pastiche in a style both accessible and sophisticated.[2] For the farcical Les petites Cardinal the music is in set pieces in the manner of an operetta. By contrast Le chevalier errant, a choreographic piece incorporating chorus and two reciters, is in an epic style.[3] Ibert\'s practice of collaborating with other composers extended to his works for the ballet stage. His first work composed expressly for the ballet was a waltz for L\'ventail de Jeanne (1929) to which he was one of ten contributors, others of whom were Ravel and Poulenc. He was the sole composer of four further ballets between 1934 and 1954.[2] For the theatre and cinema, Ibert was a prolific composer of incidental music. His best-known theatre score was music for Eugne Labiche\'s Un chapeau de paille d\'Italie, which Ibert later reworked as the suite Divertissement. Other scores ranged from music for farce to that for Shakespeare productions. His cinema scores covered a similarly broad range. He wrote the music for more than a dozen French films, and for American directors he composed a score for Orson Welles\'s 1948 film of Macbeth, and the Circus ballet for Gene Kelly\'s Invitation to the Dance in 1952.[2]'

aS'A seudat mitzvah (Hebrew:  , "commanded meal"), in Judaism, is an obligatory festive meal, usually referring to the celebratory meal following the fulfillment of a mitzvah (commandment), such as a bar mitzvah, a wedding, a brit milah (ritual circumcision), or a siyum (completing a tractate of Talmud or Mishnah). Seudot fixed in the calendar (i.e., for holidays and fasts) are also considered seudot mitzvah, but many have their own, more commonly used, names. Attendance at a brit milah (circumcision) and its subsequent seudah is of such great significance that Rabbi Moshe Isserles ("the Rama") notes (Yoreh De\'ah 265:12) that one who is invited but does not participate in the seudat brit milah is excommunicated from Hashem (God). (Babylonian Talmud tractate Pesachim 113b; Tosafot Pesachim 114a s.v. "Veein"). For this reason, people are generally not invited, but merely informed of the brit\'s time and location (Pitchei Teshuva Y.D. 265:18; Arukh HaShulkhan 265:37). Talmudic sages have compared a brit to a Korban (Temple offering), and eating at a seudat brit milah to eating a Temple offering. Hasidic Jews generally insist on serving meat at a seudat brit milah since most Temple offerings were meat. Sharing a meal is considered a bonding experience celebrating the covenant between God and the Jewish people.[1] Unlike other seudot mitzvah in which the meal (seudah) follows the act or ceremony which warrants the festive meal, the redemption ceremony for a first-born Jewish male child (called Pidyon HaBen in Hebrew), is actually part of the meal. The ceremony is led by a kohen, who ritually washes his hands, recites the blessing over bread, and partakes of some bread before beginning the ceremony. The ceremony, which follows a traditional text, is a verbal exchange between the kohen and the father of the child. The kohen asks the father if he prefers to keep his money, or pay the equivalent of five silver shekels to redeem his child. The father chooses the latter option and hands over the money, as well as recites a special blessing ("al pidyon haben"). Then the kohen verbalizes the redemption, blesses the child, and says the traditional blessing over a cup of wine, which he then drinks. The seudat mitzvah continues with all guests in attendance washing for bread and partaking of the festive meal. While attending the seudah for a Pidyon Haben, the Vilna Gaon was asked whether it was true that all the Torah\'s commandments are alluded to in Bereishit, the first portion of the Torah. After the Gaon affirmed this, he was asked where the commandment of pidyon haben was alluded to and the Gaon replied that it was in the word Bereishit, the Hebrew initials which stand for Ben Rishon Achar Sheloshim Yom Tifdeh or "a firstborn son after thirty days redeem".[2] Rabbi Shlomo Luria ("Maharshal") notes that the occasion of a youth becoming obligated to obey the commandments is to be celebrated with a religious feast, usually including a sermon the youth has prepared (Yam Shel Shlomo, Bava Kamma 7:37). It is customary at a bar mitzvah meal for parents to give thanks and praise to God for giving them the merit to raise a child to bar mitzvah and to educate him in the ways of Torah and the commandments.[3] Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef[4] holds that a Bat Mitzvah is also a seudat mitzvah. Based on the Talmud and Midrash, the seudah celebration upon the completion of a Talmudic tractate is considered a seudat mitzvah (Yam Shel Shlomo, Bava Kamma, Merubah 37; Maharam Mintz 119; Shach, Yoreh De\'ah 246:37). This seudah is made to rejoice over the accomplishment, and also to motivate and inspire others to do the same. Rabbi Chaim Elazar Shapiro (the "Munkatcher Rebbe") observes in his work Sha\'ar Yissachar that the evil inclination does not want to see this type of shared joy, noting that one of the names of the evil inclination, "Sama\'el," may be seen as an acronym for Siyum Masechet Ain La\'asot, or "do not make a siyum".[5] During the festive meal following a Jewish wedding ceremony (Hebrew Nissuin), guests participate in the mitzvah (commandment) of L\'Sameach Chatan v\'Kallah, to bring joy to the groom and bride. The emphasis of the celebration is on entertaining the newlyweds. At Orthodox wedding meals, men and women dance separately - sometimes separated by a divider - for reasons of modesty. At the end of the seudat nissuin, Grace After Meals is recited, and the Sheva Berachot (seven blessings) that were recited under the wedding canopy are repeated. Seudat Havraah is the "meal of consolation" or comfort provided for a mourner upon his or her return from the cemetery following interment of the deceased.[6] It usually consists of foods symbolic of life such as boiled eggs and lentil soup. The Talmud in Bava Batra (16b) states that the lentil stew Jacob was preparing (Genesis 25:29), and for which Esau sold his birthright, was the seudat havraah for his father Isaac who was beginning to sit shiva for his father Abraham. These include three meals on the Sabbath, as well as two (dinner and lunch) on each festival day making four each (outside Israel) for Shavuot, Rosh HaShana, Sukkot, two each for Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah, eight (outside Israel) for Passover. The Passover Seders are seudot mitzvah. Except for Seudah Shlishit (the "third meal" of Shabbat) all of these meals are preceded by Kiddush (the blessing, made over wine, recognizing the holiness of the day). If one recites Kiddush, Jewish law states that one must immediately eat the seudah in the same place that he heard/recited Kiddush (Talmud Bavli, Pesachim 101a). At Shabbat meals, it is customary to sing Zemirot (songs), learn Torah (as at meals in general) and discuss the week\'s portion of Scripture. Seudah HaMafseket is the "separating meal" eaten before the fasts of Yom Kippur and Tisha B\'Av. At the pre-Tisha B\'Av meal it is forbidden to eat meat (Mishna, Taanit 26b; Babylonian Talmud ibid. 30a), wine, and fish, or more than one cooked food. Alcoholic beverages should be avoided. The meal is eaten sitting on the ground or a low seat. It is customary to eat a hardboiled egg, and also a piece of bread dipped into ashes, and to say, "This is the Tisha B\'Av meal." During the meal, three men should not sit together so they will not have to recite the Grace after Meals as a group. None of these restrictions apply when the eve of Tisha B\'Av falls on the Sabbath.[7][8] The pre-Yom Kippur meal is a festive meal, which may include meat.[9] On Purim day, typically toward evening, a festive meal called Seudat Purim is held, with wine as a prominent beverage. While Jews have long been noted for a lack of alcohol abuse, drunkenness is not uncommon at this meal. The jovial character of this feast is illustrated in the saying of the Talmud (Megilla 7b) stating that one should drink on Purim until he can no longer distinguish between the phrases, arur Haman ("Cursed is Haman") and baruch Mordechai ("Blessed is Mordechai"). (In Hebrew these phrases have the same numerical value, and some authorities, including the Be\'er Hagolah and Magen Avraham, have ruled that one should drink wine until he is unable to calculate these numerical values.) This saying was codified in the Rif, Rosh, Tur, Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chayim 695), and is interpreted simply (as explained above) by the Chatam Sofer. This interpretation of the Talmudic statement, or the acceptance of the statement itself, is disputed (for various reasons) by the Ba\'alei Tosafot (based on the Jerusalem Talmud), Maimonides, Rabbeinu Ephraim, Ba\'al HaMa\'or, Ran, Orchot Chaim, Be\'er Hagolah, Magen Avraham, Taz, Rema, Vilna Gaon, Maharsha, Rashash, Tzeidah LaDerech, Hagahot Maimoniyot, Ra\'avyah, Korban N\'tan\'el, Bach, Maharil, P\'ri M\'gadim, Kol Bo, Chochmat Mano\'ach, Mishnah Berurah (by the Chafetz Chaim), and others. These authorities all advocate drinking wine in some quantity, but all (excepting Hagahot Maimoniyot and Ra\'avyah) discourage the level of drunkenness suggested by the Chatam Sofer. The Rema says that one should only drink a little more than he is used to drinking, and then try to fall asleep (whereupon he certainly will not be able to tell the difference between the two phrases indicated by the Talmud). This position is shared by the Kol Bo and Mishnah Berurah, and is similar to that of Maimonides. '

aS"Waterbury is a town in Washington County in central Vermont, in the United States. It is also the name of a village within that town. The population of the town was 5,064 at the 2010 census.[3] The location where Waterbury now lies was once the frontier between the Mahican and Pennacook people. European settlement of the area dates from 1763, when King George III granted a charter for land in the Winooski River valley. James Marsh became the first permanent white settler in the region in 1783. Many of the early settlers came from Waterbury, Connecticut, and named their new town in honor of the hometown.[citation needed] The village of Waterbury was incorporated in 1882 with a population of over 2,000. The Central Vermont Railroad came to Waterbury in 1849.[citation needed] The Green Mountain Seminary was built in Waterbury Center in 1869. The state opened the Vermont State Asylum for the Insane here in 1891.[4] The hospital, renamed the Vermont State Hospital, grew to occupy over 40 buildings, but by the 1980s the number of patients had declined to the point where only one building was required. The remainder of the campus came to be used for state offices.[5] Like many New England towns, Waterbury's economy was based around the local river mill industry and the surrounding agricultural producers. The mills produced products such as lumber and finished wood products, wicker products, leather, starch, and alcohol. The agriculture was based on sheep through the 19th century but switched over to dairy farming by the 20th century. Waterbury had a ski factory in the 1940s, the Derby & Ball Company. In 1927, Waterbury, like many other Vermont communities, was devastated by flooding. Inscriptions on the sides of some buildings in Waterbury village purport to show where the level of the water rose during the 1927 flood. The village recovered, and in 1938 the Waterbury Dam was built on the Little River by the Army Corps of Engineers to control future flooding in areas downstream of the town center. On August 29, 2011, Tropical Storm Irene flooded downtown Waterbury and filled the buildings of the state complex with up to 6 feet (1.8m) of water. Patients from the mental hospital were temporarily housed in various locations around Vermont, and over 1,100 of the 1,586 state employees were working in office space in other towns as of October 2011. The state was expected to decide by 2012 whether to relocate all or part of the workforce back to Waterbury. [6] Waterbury is the location of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, whose factory tours have become Vermont's most popular tourist attraction.[7] Other local businesses include: Several Vermont state government administrative offices are located in town, as are the Dale Woman's state prison and the Vermont State Hospital mental health facility. Waterbury is also surrounded by several of Vermont's heavily visited ski resorts to the north and south, including Stowe, Sugarbush and Bolton Valley. As of the census[1] of 2000, there were 4,915 people, 2,011 households, and 1,321 families residing in the town. The population density was 810.4 people per square mile (312.9/km). There were 2,106 housing units at an average density of 347.2 per square mile (134.1/km). The racial makeup of the town was 97.80% White, 0.26% African American, 0.12% Native American, 0.65% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.67% of the population. There were 2,011 households out of which 24.0% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.2% were married couples living together, 7.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.3% were non-families. 25.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 2.93. In the town the population was spread out with 25.1% under the age of 18, 5.5% from 18 to 24, 32.8% from 25 to 44, 26.2% from 45 to 64, and 10.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 37.7 years. For every 100 females there were 97.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.4 males. The median income for a household in the town was $44,940, and the median income for a family was $60,547. Males had a median income of $35,566 versus $25,838 for females. The per capita income for the town was $25,858. About 3.3% of families and 6.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.0% of those under age 18 and 4.9% of those age 65 or over. The State of Vermont operates the Waterbury Office Complex.[8] The Vermont Department of Corrections has its headquarters in the Waterbury Office Complex.[9][10] Waterbury belongs to the Washington West Supervisory Union. Students attend Thatcher Brook Primary School for grades preschool and Kindergarten through 4th grade, Crossett Brook Middle School for grades 5-8, and Harwood Union High School for grades 9-12. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides daily service to Waterbury, operating its Vermonter between St. Albans and Washington, DC. GMTA (Green Mountain Transit Agency) provides public transit bus services to Burlington, Montpelier, Morrisville and Stowe. Radio station WDEV-550 AM & 96.1 FM (News/Talk), is located in town, with its offices and studios on Stowe Street. WWMP(MP103) - 103.3 FM (Rock, Pop & R&B) is officially licensed to Waterbury and has its transmission tower located on Ricker Mountain (which it shares with sister station WNCS Montpelier), but its offices and studios are located in South Burlington."

aS"Lac des Mille Lacs is a lake in the western part of Thunder Bay District in northwestern Ontario, Canada. It is in the Nelson River drainage basin and is the source of the Seine River. The lake lies between Ontario Highway 17 on the north and Ontario Highway 11 on the south about 100 kilometres (62mi) west of the city of Thunder Bay. Lac des Mille Lacs has an area of 245.1 square kilometres (94.6sqmi) and a drainage basin of 1,774.55 square kilometres (685.16sqmi).[1] The named inflows are the Savanne River and McKay Creek at Sawmill Bay at the northeast, Joe's Creek at Baril Bay at the southwest, and Inwood Creek at the north. The only outflow, at the northwest tip of the lake, is the Seine River, which flows to Rainy Lake and eventually via the Nelson River to Hudson Bay. The lake has numerous arms, named bays and named islands. As of 2012, the Ontario government's official road map designates Lac des Mille Lacs Road, the primary access road from Highway 17 to the lake, as part of Highway 802, although the road is discontinuous with the more established southerly segment of Highway 802 between Kashabowie and Burchell Lake. The outflow to the Seine River is controlled by the Lac des Mille Lacs Dam, owned by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) and operated by the Valerie Falls Limited Partnership (Brookfield Renewable Power).[1] The first dam at the site was built of stone by Simon J. Dawson of the Department of Public Works Canada in 1873 to improve water flow for navigation in the Red River of the North far downstream.[2] This dam was replaced in 1926 by a timber dam to regulate water flow used for hydroelectric power production downstream on the Seine River and Rainy River.[2] The current concrete[2] structure was built in 1952 with seven sluices, each with eight logs.[1] With all logs, the maximum sill height is 457 metres (1,499ft), and without any the minimum height is 454.6 metres (1,491ft6in).[1] The dam project is one of several in the region which has been cited by the Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation as having displaced them from their traditional territories, including the Lac des Mille Lacs 22A1 reserve on the shore of the lake, due to flooding.[3] The First Nation, which is currently dispersed throughout Northwestern Ontario rather than living on its traditional lands, has a land claim pending negotiation with the federal and provincial governments.[3] clockwise from the Seine River outflow"

aS'Tempelhof is a railway station in the district of Berlin with the same name. It is served by the S-Bahn lines S41, S42, S45 and S46 and the U-Bahn line U6. The S-Bahn station is on an embankment at the junction of Tempelhofer Damm and Bundesautobahn 100, about 1km south of the entrance to the former Tempelhof Airport. The U-Bahn station, officially called Tempelhof (Sdring) (South Ring),[1] is under Tempelhofer Damm immediately south of the S-Bahn station. The S-Bahn station opened on 1 January 1872 as part of the opening of the Ringbahn. It was originally located somewhat further west,[2] but was relocated in 1895 to Tempelhofer Damm (then called Berliner Strae) in order to provide better integration into the rail network for a base of the Train Battalion of the Prussian Guard which was then located there. A goods station remained to the west.[2] The Ringbahn was electrified in 1928; a power station was built between the Tempelhof and Papestrae (now Sdkreuz) stations, accessible from both.[2] In 1930, it was integrated into the Berlin S-Bahn. The extension of the U-Bahn line southwards to provide an interchange station at Tempelhof occurred during the same period: the U-Bahn station opened on 22 December 1929 under Tempelhofer Damm where the South Ring crossed it, and was thus called Tempelhof (Sdring). It was designed by Alfred Grenander in an unusually spare style with open mezzanine galleries at both ends of the platform. The exit at the north end leads directly into the S-Bahn station building, which was an innovation at the time.[3][4] Until 1966 it was the southern terminus of the CII line, now the U6; the tunnel to Alt-Tempelhof was almost completely excavated when work was suspended in 1941 because of World War II, but in July 1945 a fire broke out in the turnaround and train storage area at the Tempelhof station and caused so much damage that trains terminated at Mehringdamm until February 1946.[3] After the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, West Berliners boycotted the S-Bahn to put pressure on the GDR government, which controlled the parent Deutsche Reichsbahn. The boycott led to extremely reduced S-Bahn passenger numbers, and after a strike by West Berlin S-Bahn employees to the ending of service over large stretches of the system in the West. The West Berlin portion of the Ringbahn, including the Tempelhof station, was taken out of service in September 1980.[2] The U-Bahn station, named simply Tempelhof since 1962, remained in service.[1] It was renovated in 1985; the ceiling had sustained bad water damage and was plastered over. The brightly coloured rectangular patterns on the ceiling date to this time.[3] Service was only restored on the Ringbahn after German reunification, although the Berlin Senate had been working on plans to reopen it even before the Wall fell, since the S-Bahn had been transferred in January 1984 to the BVG (Berlin Transport).[2] Sdring was again appended to the name of the Tempelhof U-Bahn station on 31 May 1992,[1] and the S-Bahn station reopened on 17 December 1993 when the segment of the South Ring between Baumschulenweg and Westend was placed back in service, and thus the station is once more a transfer point between the S-Bahn and the U-Bahn.

aS'Somerville House is an independent, boarding and day school for girls, located in South Brisbane, an inner-city suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Established in 1899 as The Brisbane High School for Girls, the School was eventually named after the British scientific writer, Mary Somerville (17801872), though the school\'s official name is still Brisbane High School for Girls. Today, Somerville House is owned by the Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association (PMSA),[5] and provides classes from Preparatory to Year 12, within three sub-schools  Junior (Years Prep to 6), Middle (Years 7 to 9), and Senior (Years 10 to 12). The school currently caters for approximately 1,200 students from Prep to Year 12,[3] including 97 boarders from Years 7 to 12.[6] Somerville House is affiliated with the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA),[7] the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA),[8] the Alliance of Girls\' Schools Australasia (AGSA),[9] the Australian Boarding Schools Association (ABSA),[6] and is a founding member of the Queensland Girls\' Secondary Schools Sports Association Inc (QGSSSA).[10] The Brisbane High School for Girls (later to be known as Somerville House) was established with 39 students on Wickham Terrace, by Eliza Fewings in October 1899.[5] The early school consisted of a large Assembly hall, drill hall, and a number of separate classrooms, with the four founding boarders living with Fewings at her home, "Glen Olive", in Toowong.[11] Fewings, who had previously been Headmistress of the Brisbane Girls\' Grammar School,[12] but after being dismissed, decided to open her own school, she aimed to create a school community where girls could be educated and equipped with social graces, and would be able to take a leading role in the management of the nation.[5][13] Based on English models, within three years it became the largest girls\' secondary school in Queensland, with 150 students.[13] In 1900, the boarders moved to "Whytecliffe" at Albion, a property which still stands in Whytecliffe Street. In July 1903, the boarders were moved again, this time to "Garth House" on Wickham Terrace, which was closer to the Day School. Early in 1906, after Miss Fewings returned from a trip abroad, the boarding students were relocated once more to "Cheltenham", which was situated in what is now Jephson Street, Toowong.[11] Constance Harker and Marjorie Jarrett purchased the school in 1909, and so began their partnership as co-Principals. The two women had met while teaching at the Presbyterian Ladies\' College, Sydney, where Harker was senior English and classics mistress.[14] Following their purchase of the school, they searched for a site in Brisbane that could house the day and boarding schools under one roof, and in 1912, settled on "Erneton" on Wickham Terrace, which was located next door to the boarders previous residence, "Garth House". A paddock at the rear of Garth House was rented for a netball court. As time went on, space became limited at the new site, and so Athol Place, a few doors away on the Terrace was rented for extra Boarders and two primary classes.[11] Harker and Jarrett gained little income from the school, as teacher-proprietors had little chance of financing a modern expanding school, especially one with boarding facilities. In 1918, due to these financial struggles, they transferred ownership to the newly formed Presbyterian and Methodist Schools Association, while retaining their Principalship. In 1920 the school moved from Wickham Terrace to its present site on Mater Hill, in South Brisbane, opening with an enrolment of 225 pupils. The boarding-school occupied "Cumbooquepa", the now National Trust listed, former home of prominent Brisbane businessman, newspaper publisher, and one time Mayor of Brisbane, Thomas Blackett Stephens (built 1890).[5][14] At this time the school\'s name was changed to Somerville House, in recognition of the work of Mary Somerville (17801872), a famous Scottish scientist and mathematician of the 19th century.[5] Over the next two decades the school carried out a major building programme and established a good reputation.[14] Harker retired in 1931, but continued to live at the boarding school until Jarrett\'s retirement in 1940. During her time as Principal, she gained a reputation in Queensland as a pioneer in the education of girls. The academic achievements of Somerville House during her co-Principalship were amongst the best in the state, and she widened the interests of her pupils by encouraging visitors who were authorities on literature, music, art and international affairs. She encouraged good citizenship and social service, and during World War I formed the first school branch of the Red Cross Society in Queensland. The school subsequently had branches of the Australian Student Christian Movement and the League of Nations Union, two companies of Girl Guides, and a Cot Fund which supported the ill and disabled. The still functioning Queensland Girls\' Secondary Schools Sports Association (QGSSSA), was initiated by her.[14] On Saturday 24 January 1942, Military authorities visited Somerville House with a view to taking it over.[15] The school was officially commandeered by the Australian Military Forces on 1 February,[16] and was later used as Base Section Three Headquarters[15] of the United States Army, East Asian Command, for the duration of the Second World War.[5] Pupils from north of the Brisbane River were transferred to Raymont Lodge, at Auchenflower, while those from the south went to the former Queen Alexandra Home, Coorparoo; boarding students were sent to Moiomindah at Stanthorpe, which became the school\'s administrative centre. Based at Stanthorpe, the Principal at the time, Elinor Frances Craig, managed the three dispersed centres and frequently commuted by rail to maintain a presence in Brisbane. The school returned to South Brisbane with minimal inconvenience in January 1945, and classes commenced on 6 February.[16] The American forces still occupied the upper floor of the school\'s education block with an armed guard at the door.[12] The years since the war have seen many changes to Cumbooquepa, which is now used as a boarding house. Restoration work was undertaken in 1980 in order to preserve the building. The first new building since the library in 1934 was opened in 1960, the MK Jarrett School of Music and Drama. This has been followed with further construction, including the Aquatic Centre, Seymour Centre, classrooms, and the Valmai Pidgeon Performing Arts Complex, opened in 2000. In 1986, Old Girls of the School rallied from around the country in protest of an offer to the School Council from an overseas syndicate, to purchase the School for use as a trade centre, adjoining the Expo \'88 site. This offer was eventually rejected.[12] On 15 June 1999, the school purchased the adjacent heritage-listed Old South Brisbane Town Hall. The school uses the buildings for offices and function rooms.[17] Somerville House typically performs well in state-wide examinations, scoring the second highest rating for academic outcomes from girls\' schools, directly after Brisbane Girls Grammar School in the Queensland Studies Authority\'s 2005 report.[citation needed]  The deployment of laptop computers to the staff and students of Somerville House began in 2001 and continued to the pilot laptop deployment to Year 6 students during Semester 2, 2003. Laptops are currently used by all students from grades 6 to 12. The School Badge appeared for the first time on the cover of the June Magazine in 1902, and was designed by architect, Robin Dods.[4] The central figure represents Wisdom, standing upon or emerging from, the open book, representing Knowledge. In her hand is a lamp, representing Truth. The school motto, Honour before Honours, can be found at the base of the badge.[5] In 1912 the original school colours of yellow and white were changed to navy blue and green. The colours of the School badge are blue, green and white, with blue associated with loyalty, green representing growth, and white representing purity.[4] From 1949, the name Somerville House surmounted the badge and the side letters of B.G.H.S. were omitted.[4] Somerville House utilises a house system. During World War II, a limited house system was first introduced to encourage participation in sport. The two houses were named Leslie and Cunningham, after two local pioneers. After the school was reunited at Vulture Street in 1945, it was decided to divide the school from Form IVA (Year 12) to Form IIB (Year 3), into four groups. The Houses (Chrisholm, Franklin, MacArthur and Osburn) were named after outstanding women in Australian history. First Form and Kindergarten (Prep, Years 1 and 2) had their own system, Elves, Goblins, Fairies and Pixies. It was not until 1983, when the school had grown significantly, that two more Houses were started  Durack and Gilmore.[20] Today the school has six houses, each named after an Australian woman who was a pioneer in her field: The houses have competed for the Adamson Shield since 1947, a gift of Dr R V Adamson, father of a past pupil. In 1948, Mr D.J Drysdale donated a shield for competition in Choral singing between the Houses, which is still presented at the annual Choral Festival.[20] Inter-house competitions held throughout the year, include a Swimming Carnival, Athletics Carnival, Cross Country, Hockey, Speedball (fusion of netball and soccer - frequently played in physical education claseses at Somerville), Chess Competition, Senior School Choral Festival (Years 10-12), and Middle School Arts Festival (Years 7-9). Alumnae of Somerville House are known as Old Girls, and may elect to join the schools alumni association, the Somerville House Old Girls\' Association (OGA). The OGA was established in 1901.[21] Some notable Somerville House Old Girls include:'

aS'Maurelle Island is an island in British Columbia, Canada. It is part of the Discovery Islands between Vancouver Island and the mainland, between the Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait. Maurelle Island is located northeast of Quadra Island, southeast of Sonora Island, and north of Read Island. The island is separated from the mainland by Calm Channel, from Quadra Island by Okisollo Channel, from Read Island by Whiterock Passage, and from Sonora Island by a narrow strait called Hole in the Wall. The narrow passage between Quadra Island and Antonio Point, the southern tip of Maurelle Island, is known as Surge Narrows. Tidal currents in the narrows average 7.0 knots (3.6m/s) at maximum flow.[1] Surge Narrows Provincial Park is located on the southern tip of Maurelle Island.[2] Maurelle Island was given its name in 1903 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, in honor of the Spanish naval officer Francisco Antonio Mourelle de la Ra.[3] '

aS"Pico da Cruz (Portuguese meaning the peak of the cross) is a volcanic mountain in the eastern part of the island of Santo Anto. The mountain is accessed with a road linking with the island capital of Porto Novo. The mountain is of volcanic origin and features a caldeira of around 800 m in diameter and approximately 100 in elevation. The mountain are made up of rocks with soil colours being tan and light brown. The mountain contains rugged and treacherous slopes and ledges in its valleys, a few areas are not as treacherous. The mountain features grasslands and bushes along with unvegetated parts especially at the peak and forests and bushes in sporadic parts of the peak. Unpaved and earthened roads encircles the mountain and are not frequently used. Rugged and treacherous valleys covers the area around the mountain. The island's easternmost lighthouse is to the east by the cliffy coastline and is accessed with a road in poor condition encircling the eastern half of the island and linking with Paul and Porto Novo. It is accessed with a road linking to the LBRA 2? (Porto Novo-Ribeira Grande Road) and famously, the caldeira has farmlands which features banana plantations and other crops including cattle, fruits and vegetables including tomatoes and others. It is the few caldeiras ever to contain farmlands, the second is being Ch das Caldeiras which is smaller but the caldeira is larger. The mountain offers a panoramic view of most of the island except for a part of the central part which is blocked by a few mountains and the western parts, it also offer views of much of the island of So Vicente except for the southeastern and the southern portions and on clearer days it can also see Santa Luzia as well as the islets of Branco and Raso, it also offers a view of the Atlantic Ocean.

aS'Feed-forward is a term describing an element or pathway within a control system which passes a controlling signal from a source in its external environment, often a command signal from an external operator, to a load elsewhere in its external environment. A control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; it is in contrast with a system that also has feedback, which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system. In a feed-forward system, the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about or measurements of the process disturbances".[1] Some prerequisites are needed for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external command or controlling signal must be available, and the effect of the output of the system on the load should be known (that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time). Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called \'ballistic\', because once a control signal has been sent, it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal. In contrast \'cruise control\' adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism. These systems could relate to control theory, physiology or computing. With feed-forward control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system. In the house example, a feed-forward system may measure the fact that the door is opened and automatically turn on the heater before the house can get too cold. The difficulty with feed-forward control is that the effect of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted, and there must not be any unmeasured disturbances. For instance, if a window was opened that was not being measured, the feed-forward-controlled thermostat might still let the house cool down. The term has specific meaning within the field of CPU-based Automatic control. The discipline of feedforward control as it relates to modern, CPU based automatic controls is widely discussed, but is seldom practiced due to the difficulty and expense of developing or providing for the mathematical model required to facilitate this type of control. Open-loop control and feedback control, often based on canned PID control algorithms, are much more widely used.[2][3][4] There are three types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. An example of a pure open loop control system is manual non-power-assisted steering of a motor car; the steering system does not have access to an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, power steering has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism. This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See Model predictive control. If you include the driver in the system, then he does provide a feedback path by observing the direction of travel and compensating for errors by turning the steering wheel. In that case you have a feedback system, and the block labeled "System" in Figure(c) is a feed-forward system. In other words, systems of different types can be nested, and the overall system regarded as a black-box. Feedforward control is distinctly different from open loop control and teleoperator systems. Feedforward control requires a mathematical model of the plant (process and/or machine being controlled) and the plant\'s relationship to any inputs or feedback the system might receive. Neither open loop control nor teleoperator systems require the sophistication of a mathematical model of the physical system or plant being controlled. Control based on operator input without integral processing and interpretation through a mathematical model of the system is a teleoperator system and is not considered feedforward control.[5][6] Historically, the use of the term feedforward is found in works by D. M. MacKay as early as 1956. While MacKays work is in the field of biological control theory, he speaks only of feedforward systems. MacKay does not mention Feedforward Control or allude to the discipline of Feedforward Controls. MacKay and other early writers who use the term feedforward are generally writing about theories of how human or animal brains work.[7] The discipline of feedforward controls was largely developed by professors and graduate students at Georgia Tech, MIT, Stanford and Carnegie Mellon. Feedforward is not typically hyphenated in scholarly publications. Meckl and Seering of MIT and Book and Dickerson of Georgia Tech began the development of the concepts of Feedforward Control in the mid 1970s. The discipline of Feedforward Controls was well defined in many scholarly papers, articles and books by the late 1980s.[5][8][9][10] The benefits of feedforward control are significant and can often justify the extra cost, time and effort required to implement the technology. Control accuracy can often be improved by as much as an order of magnitude if the mathematical model is of sufficient quality and implementation of the feedforward control law is well thought out. Energy consumption by the feedforward control system and its driver is typically substantially lower than with other controls. Stability is enhanced such that the controlled device can be built of lower cost, lighter weight, springier materials while still being highly accurate and able to operate at high speeds. Other benefits of feedforward control include reduced wear and tear on equipment, lower maintenance costs, higher reliability and a substantial reduction in hysteresis. Feedforward control is often combined with feedback control to optimize performance.[5][11][12][13][9] The mathematical model of the plant (machine, process or organism) used by the feedforward control system may be created and input by a control engineer or it may be learned by the control system.[14] Control systems capable of learning and/or adapting their mathematical model have become more practical as microprocessor speeds have increased. The discipline of modern feedforward control was itself made possible by the invention of microprocessors.[5][6] Feedforward control requires integration of the mathematical model into the control algorithm such that it is used to determine the control actions based on what is known about the state of the system being controlled. In the case of control for a lightweight, flexible robotic arm, this could be as simple as compensating between when the robot arm is carrying a payload and when it is not. The target joint angles are adjusted to place the payload in the desired position based on knowing the deflections in the arm from the mathematical models interpretation of the disturbance caused by the payload. Systems that plan actions and then pass the plan to a different system for execution do not satisfy the above definition of feedforward control. Unless the system includes a means to detect a disturbance or receive an input and process that input through the mathematical model to determine the required modification to the control action, it is not true feedforward control.[15][16][17] In physiology, feed-forward control is exemplified by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion. Feed-forward control can be likened to learned anticipatory responses to known cues. Feedback regulation of the heartbeat provides further adaptiveness to the running eventualities of physical exertion. Feedforward systems are also found in biological control by human and animal brains.[18] Even in the case of biological feedforward systems, such as in the human brain, knowledge or a mental model of the plant (body) can be considered to be mathematical as the model is characterized by limits, rhythms, mechanics and patterns.[7][15] A pure feed-forward system is distinct from a homeostatic control system, which has the function of keeping the internal environment of the body steady or constant or in a prolonged steady state of readiness, and relies mainly on feedback, indeed on negative feedback, in addition to the feedforward elements of the system. The cross regulation of genes can be represented by a graph, where genes are the nodes and one node is linked to another if the former is a transcription factor for the latter. A motif which predominantly appears in all known networks (E. coli, Yeast,...) is A activates B, A and B activate C. This motif has been shown to be a feed forward system, detecting non-temporary change of environment. This feed forward control theme is commonly observed in hematopoietic cell lineage development, where irreversible commitments are made. In computing, feed-forward normally refers to a perceptron network in which the outputs from all neurons go to following but not preceding layers, so there are no feedback loops. The connections are set up during a training phase, which in effect is when the system is a feedback system. In the early 1970s, intercity coaxial transmission systems, including L-carrier, used feed-forward amplifiers to diminish linear distortion. This more complex method allowed wider bandwidth than earlier feedback systems. Optical fiber, however, made such systems obsolete before many were built. Feedforward control is a discipline within the field of automatic controls used in automation.'

aS'Bhimavaram is a city mandal under Bhimavaram urban agglomeration [1] in the West Godavari District in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. Bhimavaram is also called the "Second Bardoli of India".[2] Mahatma Gandhi coined the name when he visited the town during the freedom movement in India. It is one of the Pancharama Kshetras (Somaramam) in AP state, as it has Someswara Swami temple. It is the aqua capital of the coastal area. Bhimavaram city is a shopping hub in the district for products like jewellery, cloth, seafood, electronics. According to Indian statistics 2011. It comes under Bhimavaram Metropolitan comprising Bhimavaram town, Rayalam and Chinamiram villages. Bhimavaram is a business and trade center for aqua and paddy business and a prime center for commerce and business. It is a fully developed education center with many education institutions. The population of Bhimavaram city is approximately 2 lakhs and is divided into 39 wards geographically. It has been upgraded as a selection grade corporation. It is an epicenter of district political activities, facilitated with all regional offices. It is a city where the per capita income is high. It produces rich aqua wealth (mainly fresh water fish and prawns) in the country and it is next to Cochin (a major seaport city in Kerala state of India abundant with rich aqua wealth). Bhimavaram is connected to by road and rail to all major cities. It has two railway stations (junction and town stations) and a bus station with a bus depot with several fleet of buses. It has train facility connected to metropolitan cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkota, Mumbai and connected with a train to temple city Tirupathi. The nearest air port is Rajahmundry (nearly 90.k.m) and Vijayawada (110 k.m) Bhimavaram now progressing with overall development. It is a city of many religions, castes and sub castes. It is a cosmopolitan city with communal harmony and religious tolerance.[3] Bhimavaram has many nicknames, being called by Mahatma Gandhi as the "second Bardoli" when he visited the town during the freedom movement in India, the second Mumbai for its economic strength, and the Las Vegas of India due to gambling being popular, especially gambling on cricket, cock-fighting during the festive season of Sankranthi.[4] Somaramam Bhimavaram is famous for the Gunupudi Someswara (Somarama) temple, which is one of the holy Pancharamas. Built during the 3rd century A.D., the Shiva lingam change its color according to the lunar month (Black at the time of, White at the time Pournami). Annapurna mata temple is present in the second floor.[5] Another unique feature there, is that the temple of Goddess Annapurna was built on top of the Shiva temple, something that cannot be seen anywhere in the country. The goddess has the sacred thread around her neck and a baby near her feet. This temple is an old temple but looks like a new one because of colored paintings on the walls and sculptures. In front of the temple is a pond called Chandrakundam. It is fully covered with lotus flowers. There is a big Gopuram as the entrance of temple. On the left side of temple is a big hall in which temples of Lord Srirama and Hanuma are present. On the right side of temple there is an open hall above the temple office. When a crowd is present, pujaris / Pandits conduct puja there for individuals. The temple has many sculptures which are giving a nice look. In the hall of temple there is a big statue of Nandi. After crossing hall there is a room in front of sanctum. In that room there is a temple of Annapurna mata. In the sanctum one can see Lord Shiva in the form of a Shivaling. Shivaling in this temple is small unlike in other Pancharamas. There is a speciality in this temple i.e. Shivaling will change its color according to lunar aspect. At the time of Pournami (full moon nights), shivaling will be in white color and in Amavasya days (dark nights) its color shades black. Lord Someswara swamy was first worshipped by Moon god here after Tarakasura vadha. Hence in the name of Moon god, came the names Somaramam and Someswara swamy.[6] Mavullamma Temple Sri Sri Sri Jaganmatha Mavullamma ammavaru: Protector of people from evil spirits. It is believed by deities that Jaganmatha (universal mother goddess) Sri Mavullamma ammavaru (mother goddess) is the incarnation of Mahakali (the goddess of Shakthi-Power) in olden days. she is in a midst of mango groves. So she is called \'Mavullamma\' (Mamidi is local tongue to Mango). It is believed by deities that neighbour villagers treat her as their own villages mother goddess, so that she is addressed as \'Mavullamma\' (mother goddess of my own village). The temple history of Jaganmatha Sri Mavullamma came to light in 1880 AD. Since then only the temple history is available. It is estimated by people that she is laid in Motupallivari street, under couple of pipal and Neem tree. Every year in the month of "Jyesta masa" (third month of auspicious Telugu almanac calendar) on "Paadyami" (new slender crescent moon day), devotees (worshippers) celebrate one month-long celebration in this month. There is a festive look everywhere in and around the city. The Devastanam (temple committee) and local fruit and vegetable traders committee felicitates artists, actors, actresses, musicians, great men of all walks of the life. In 1910 AD, floods the Mulavirat (Statue of Mavullamma) partially damaged. Later reinstated by artist, sculptor Sri Grandhi Narasanna\'s son Sri Grandhi Appa Rao. He carved the Mulavirat (Mavullamma Statue) from ferocious stature to pleasant present peace form. Along with much of present-day coastal Andhra Pradesh, Bhimavaram was controlled by the Chola Empire. Under Kulothunga Chola I, Bhimavaram was ruled by his sons who served as viceroys. Various stone inscriptions have been found in the city dating from his reign (c. 1096 C.E.).[7] Bhimavaram is a temple city of Lord Someswara, which is one of the five famous holy Pancharama Kshetras (five holy shrines of Lord Shiva). It is a pilgrim city, Where the king of Eastern Chalukya kings king Chalukya Bheema in the year 890-918 A.D he himself laid foundation and constructed a Siva temple. It is present Gunupudi. In the name of king Chalukya Bheema a town (puram) Bhimapuram developed.Bhimapuram gradually changed into present Bhimavaram city. Bhimavaram is the gift of king Chalukya Bheema. It is now developed into a prominent city. According to holy scriptures \'Bheema\' means Lord Eeswara (lord Siva).

Then it is a Smallwood with thorny bushes. Difficult to walk even to pedestrians. In the year 1150 some migrate families cut the trees, cleared the thorn bushes, and leveled the land to dwell and settled. It is said by the elders then Bhimavaram is neither a city nor a village.

aS'"Devils Haircut" is a single by Beck, taken from the album Odelay. The music video for the song is directed by Mark Romanek. It features Beck walking through various New York City locations, wearing cowboy attire and carrying a boombox. At some points, the action freezes and the camera zooms in on Beck in tableau. Later the camera zooms in on spies that have been following Beck the whole time. The video has references to the films Midnight Cowboy and The 400 Blows. At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards Beck won a total of five "moonmen" awards. Two were for The New Pollution, and Devils Haircut won three: Best Editing, Best Direction, and Best Male Video.[1] As is common with his Odelay-era songs, "Devils Haircut" is driven by a number of samples: the drums in the choruses and drum breaks come from Pretty Purdie\'s "Soul Drums"; the drumbeat during the verses comes from Them\'s cover of James Brown\'s "Out of Sight"; and the guitar riff was taken from another Them cover (this time of "I Can Only Give You Everything"), but it was replayed by Beck rather than sampled.[2] On top of this mix of instrumental borrowings, Beck sings about "stealing kisses from the leprous faces", "discount orgies", and "garbage man trees". The song\'s lyrics are full of poetry and mental shortcuts. The lyrics here emulate minimalistic phrases as may be used when not communicating outside of the inner mind. As such, the words are representative of a metaphorical concept of something observed in the world.[citation needed] The song is dotted with references to the wandering disorientation that comes with touring, such as "coming to town with the briefcase blues". Beck himself has talked about the meaning of "Devils Haircut" on a few occasions. In one interview, he claimed that it was "a really simplistic metaphor for a devils haircut". 7" "Devils Haircut" was released with a number of B-sides, which included many remixes: CD #1 includes two remixes. One by Noel Gallagher of Oasis, and the other by Mike Simpson of The Dust Brothers. The former adds a roaring guitar, emphasised over all other instruments on the track whilst the latter is a more jazzy take on the song, packed with added percussion and jazz horns. CD #2 includes "Dark and Lovely", another sample-laden Dust Brothers remix, and "American Wasteland", by Mickey P, which transforms the song into a fast, hardcore punk style song. Both CDs had one original B-side in addition to the remixes. CD #1 had "Trouble All My Days", an early song from 1993 which is characterized by deep, distorted vocals and Beck\'s thrashing his loosely-tuned strings. "Trouble All My Days" had been featured on "Pay No Mind (Snoozer)", Golden Feelings and two other releases prior to its inclusion on "Devils Haircut" CD #1. CD #2 features ".000.000," a previously unreleased song with a strange, minimalistic instrumental background and difficult to discern lyrics. ".000.000" was also released on "The New Pollution". Another remix, "Richard\'s Hairpiece", was done courtesy of Aphex Twin, in which the riff is removed, and Beck\'s vocals are sped up to the extent that his voice is extremely high-pitched. This remix was not included on either CD version of "Devils Haircut", because of Aphex Twin\'s delay in making it, but it was included on the subsequent CD for "The New Pollution".'

Prior to her ministerial career, Dr. Joy Ogwu, who is from Delta State, served as DirectorGeneral of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA). Ogwu has advised the United Nations on disarmament issues and has published books promoting more African ties to Latin America. She is the former Chair of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR). She was appointed Foreign Minister by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo on August 30, 2006. In 2008, Ogwu became the Permanent Representative of Nigeria to the UN in New York. Ogwu was the President of the UN Security Council in July 2010 and in October 2011. She is currently the President of the Executive Board of the UN Women Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. Ogwu obtained her BA and MA in Political Science from Rutgers University. She later received her Ph.D. from the University of Lagos in Nigeria. While obtaining her Ph.D. in 1977, she joined the Institute of International Affairs at the University of Lagos. Ogwu started her career as an assistant lecturer at the Nigerian National War College and the Nigerian Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS). She subsequently joined the NIIA as a lecturer, obtaining a research fellowship during which she authored her first book, Nigerian Foreign Policy: Alternative Futures (Macmillan, 1986). She eventually headed the research department in International Politics, leading on to her role as the first female Director General. Professor Ogwu's career has been distinct in its additional focus on the developing countries of Latin America enabling an investigation into the possibilities of a proficient South-South relationship between Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. In this capacity she held a visiting fellowship at the University of London's Institute of Latin American Studies and has been published extensively in Portuguese, Spanish, French and Croatian. As an expert on security issues, she serves on the United Nations Secretary General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters. As a woman in a foremost position in her distinguished career specialization, Ogwu has become a voice for women's development and human rights. In this subject, her perspective spans Asia Pacific, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa with prolific publications on regional aspects of the subject.

aS"The Waco Standard Cabin series is a range of American single-engine 4-5 seat fabric covered cabin biplanes produced by the Waco Aircraft Company beginning in 1931 with the QDC and continuing until 1942 when production ended for the VKS-7F.[1] They were used as light passenger and utility transports, navigational trainers, bushplanes and briefly as maritime reconnaissance aircraft during World War 2. All of the Waco Standard Cabins were powered by cowled radial engines and Waco tried to accommodate their customers preferences for many of the more common commercially available engines of the period, hence the profusion of designations, as the first letter indicates the engine installed. Individual models were each certified with various available engines but not all variations found customers. Fuselage structure was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in and covered with fabric.[2] Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric.[2] Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum.[2] Most models were not fitted with flaps - the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception.[3] It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and just ahead of the ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight[2] and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel[2] sprung with triangulated shock cords.[4] was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid.[5] Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats.[6] Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.[7] The standard cabin series were Waco's first successful cabin biplane design, and was developed to accompany the F series airframe in their lineup.[8] The Model C series had the top longerons raised to form a four-seat cabin which was entered through a door between the wings on the left side and had a rather distinctive rear-view window that was cleaned up, and then dispensed with in the later standard cabins. The initial QDC model of 1931 was offered with a 165hp (123kW) Continental A70 cowled engine,[4] or as the BDC, ODC, PDC and UDC with other engines (as listed under variants). 1932 saw the introduction of the OEC and UEC models. Continuous refinement and improvement by Waco Aircraft resulted in production of various sub-models continuing until 1939.[9] In 1935, Waco introduced its slightly larger Custom Cabin series (which featured a sesquiplane layout without ailerons on the lower wing) and decided to differentiate between the Standard and Custom Cabin types by appending an S to the model designator. in 1936 the C-S was replaced with an 'S' signifying 'Standard'.[10] For example, the YKC of 1934 became the YKC-S of 1935 and the YKS of 1936, though with additional minor improvements. The Standard Cabin series, with its cabin comfort, proved to be popular with private pilot owners. Many were purchased by small commercial aviation firms and non-aviation businesses. With the onset of World War II, examples were impressed into the air forces of many Allied nations, including the US (USAAC and US Navy), the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. USAAC Designations assigned to standard cabin Wacos included UC-72D (for 2 VKS-7s), UC-72K (for 1 YKS-7) and UC-72M (for 2 ZKS-7s). Most were used as utility aircraft, however a small number were operated by the US Civil Air Patrol, conducting anti-submarine patrols off the US coastline from March 1942 to August 1943 armed with 50 or 100 pound bombs.[11] In 1942 21 VKS-7F were built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program for use as navigational trainers. A single impressed YKC referred to as the Little Waco, RAF serial AX697, was used by the British Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) along with a Waco Custom Cabin ZGC-7 Big Waco to support their activities behind Axis lines.[12] Approximately 135 Standard Cabin series aircraft of several sub-models are currently registered in the USA.[13] Data from Aerofiles[10] Most operators operated either a single example, or a very small number. Waco Custom Cabins were used in small numbers by a very large number of individual operators and were registered in the following countries (note that this list is not exhaustive).[28] Aside from the large number of Wacos that continue to exist in private hands,[29] a number have also found their way into museums.

aS"The Saltburn Miniature Railway is a 15in (381mm) gauge railway at Saltburn, in Redcar and Cleveland, England. The railway opened in 1947[1] as a tourist attraction. It was originally a simple out-and-back line with a station at each end. During 1953 the line was adapted to allow the simultaneous operation of two trains, though without the provision of a passing loop. Instead, a single siding was provided into which one train had to reverse to allow the other to pass by. During the 1980s the operation of the railway was taken over by an Association of supporters, all of whom are volunteers. A decision was made to extend the railway, relocate one terminus completely, and provide new sidings and engine sheds. This major project, known on the railway as 'The Big Transformation' took place between September 2000 and April 2003.[2] The line runs north from Cat Nab Station (by the beach) for about  mile inland to Forest Halt, where there is a woodland walk and gardens.[3] There is a run around loop at each end of the line[3][4] and an engine and rolling stock depot near the midpoint.[5] Prince Charles is the only serviceable mainline locomotive on the railway, and has been the principle engine continuously since 1953.[6] However, the new operators have provided a lightweight engine for works trains, and have also obtained a new mainline engine, Flying Scotsman, although this locomotive requires considerable work before it will be in a serviceable condition. Meanwhile, there are visiting steam locomotives at the railway for most summer seasons, providing additional motive power, and additional interest for visitors. The passengers carried in the first season (1947) were obliged to sit in freight wagons - scale model 7-plank open wagons, with crude cross-bar seats fitted. However, for the 1948 season the railway acquired two bogie passenger coaches with reversible seats whose backs could be tipped to allow the passenger to face the direction of travel. In 1953 the railway took delivery of four new passenger coaches, each seating 16 passengers (in 4 compartments of 4 seats each); at a subsequent, but unknown, date the two earlier coaches were withdrawn. When the current operators took over the line they made temporary use of the last two serviceable coaches of 1953 vintage, though these have since been withdrawn. There are now four passenger coaches, all of modern build and metal construction. Three are enclosed, and one is open. Three of these coaches have exterior platforms for a guard or guards to travel upon.[8] The 1948 coaches operated with a replica brake van, since withdrawn. Today the railway has three works wagons - a general works truck, a tanker truck, and an air compressor wagon. Coordinates: 543457N 05807W / 54.582571N 0.968728W / 54.582571; -0.968728"

aS'Horace Wilson (February 10, 1843  March 4, 1927) was an American expatriate educator in late 19th century Empire of Japan. He is one of the persons credited with introducing the sport of baseball to Japan. Wilson was born in Gorham, Maine. A veteran of the American Civil War, where he fought for the 12th Maine Regiment against the Confederates in Louisiana, he was hired by the Japanese government as a foreign adviser to assist in the modernization of the Japanese education system after the Meiji Restoration. He served as a professor of English at Kaisei Gakko, the forerunner of Tokyo Imperial University. In either 1872 or 1873, Wilson decided that his students needed more physical exercise, and introduced them to the sport of baseball. Several weeks or months later, enough interest had developed for the school to sponsor a seven inning game between the Japanese students and foreign instructors. The first formal baseball team was established in 1878. Wilson returned to America in 1877 and lived in San Francisco. He died in 1927 at age 84. Wilson was posthumously elected to membership in the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame by the special committee in 2003. '

aS"Politics of the United States\nPolitical parties\nElections The Minnesota FarmerLabor Party (FL) was a left-wing American political party in Minnesota between 1918 and 1944. Largely dominating Minnesota politics during the Great Depression, it was one of the most successful statewide third party movements in United States history and the longest-lasting affiliate of the national Farmer-Labor movement. At its height in the 1920s and 1930s, party members included three Minnesota Governors, four United States Senators, eight United States Representatives and a majority in the Minnesota legislature. In 1944, Hubert H. Humphrey and Elmer Benson worked to merge the party with the state's Democratic Party, forming the contemporary Minnesota DemocraticFarmerLabor Party.[1] The Minnesota FarmerLabor Party emerged from the Non-Partisan League in North Dakota and the Union Labor Party in Duluth, Minnesota on a platform of farmer and labor union protection, government ownership of certain industries, and social security laws.[2] One of the primary obstacles of the party, besides constant vilification on the pages of local and state newspapers, was the difficulty of uniting the party's divergent base and maintaining political union between rural farmers and urban laborers who often had little in common other than the populist perception that they were an oppressed class of hardworking producers exploited by a small elite. According to political scientist George Mayer: The Minnesota Democratic Party, led by Hubert Humphrey, was able to merge the FarmerLabor party with the Minnesota Democratic Party on April 15, 1944. Since 1944, the two parties together make up the Minnesota DemocraticFarmerLabor Party."

aS'Helgy Church (Norwegian: Helgy kirke) is a historic parish church in the municipality of Karlsy in Troms county, Norway. It is located on the island of Helgya. The church is part of the Karlsy parish in the Troms arch-deanery in the Diocese of Nord-Hlogaland. The 350-seat church is no longer in regular use since the island of Helgya is no longer populated. The church is used on occasion for special services, including one summer service each year.[1] This church was originally built in 1741 in Hemnes in Helgeland. In 1872 it was taken down and moved to Hamn in Berg municipality on Senja island. It was rebuilt there as a church by the nickel plant. When the plant closed in 1888, the church was once again dismantled and moved to Helgya to replace an earlier church building. It was consecrated on 7 March 1889 by the Bishop Johannes Skaar.[2] '

aS'William Robinson Baker (18201890) was a U.S. politician who was a Texas State Senator and Mayor of Houston, Texas. Baker was born 21 May 1820 in Onondaga County, New York to Asa Baker and the former Hannah Robinson. He lived in New York until age 17 at which time he moved to Houston in the Republic of Texas. There he was a bookkeeper for the Houston Town Company for about two years and ran a general store for two years after that. In 1841, Baker successfully ran for County Clerk of Harris County, a position he held for 16 years. Baker married Hester E. Runnels, niece of former Mississippi Governor Hiram Runnels, in December 1845. In 1852, Baker became the Secretary of the Texas Central Railroad, and in 1856, Secretary of the Houston and Texas Central Railroad. He eventually became Director and the Vice President of the line. From 1868 to 1871 was President of the railroad, and from 1873 to 1875, served as Vice-President and Manager. He sold his interests and retired from the railroad business in 1877. In 1874, Baker was elected to the Texas Senate from the 16th District and served one term. Baker was elected mayor of Houston and served for six years, from 1880 to 1886. Baker died in 1890.[1] '

aS'Jeff Danziger (born 1943 in New York, New York) is a syndicated political cartoonist and author. Danziger served in the United States Army from 1967 until 1971. An intelligence officer and linguist during the Vietnam War, he was awarded the Bronze Star and Air Medal in 1970. In 1971 he began teaching English at Union 32 High School in East Montpelier, Vermont where he taught specialized classes in journalism and expository writing at an advanced level, and worked for the Christian Science Monitor between 1987 and 1997. As of 2009, he has been published by the Los Angeles Times syndicate.[1] He now lives in New York City. Danziger was listed on Bernard Goldberg\'s list of "100 People Who Are Screwing Up America." Danziger described the listing as "an honor." In an interview with The Comics Journal, Danziger said, "Keep in mind that I agree with a great many things that the Republicans have been traditionally for. I am in favor of a solid economy. I am in favor of a strong dollar. I am in favor of looking after troops. I am in favor of maintaining a strong army, and I am in favor of the ability to go into business and make a profit and not pay taxes for silly purposes." Danziger lampooned the Bush administration in many of his cartoons, some of which are collected in the anthologies Wreckage Begins with \'W\' and Blood, Debt and Fears. In addition to his editorial cartoons, he also created the comic strip McGonigle of the Chronicle, which ran from 1983 to 1985 in newspapers across the country, and a weekly series \'The Teeds: Tales of Agriculture for the Young and Old\' that continues to run in Vermont newspapers.[1][2] When Condoleezza Rice was nominated to be U.S. Secretary of State, Danzinger put together a cartoon that was critical of Rice where he used racial stereotypes concerning the look and speech of African Americans. Danzinger was criticized by the National Black Republican Association who stated that Danzinger "depicted Dr. Rice as an ignorant, barefoot "mammy," reminiscent of the stereotyped black woman in the movie Gone with the Wind who remarked: "I don\'t know nothin\' \'bout birthin\' no babies.\'"[3] In October 2005, Danzinger published a cartoon in the Rutland Herald depicting a scientist unearthing a roulette wheel at an Abenaki archaeological site. Examining the artwork carefully one finds in very small print "Sweat Lodge Casino." The portrayal of Indians as casino operators outraged Native Americans across the country. This cartoon served to highlight a larger part of Indian portrayal in the media. "Publishers of newspapers think it\'s OK to mock and offend Indians, they say, \'How could this possibly be racist, we\'re only kidding.\' The institution of media is in denial about promoting racism. In fact, they don\'t even notice."[4]'

aS'Agona-Akrofonso is a serene and scenic town in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The town is an hour\'s drive from Kumasi, the Ashanti regional capital. Agona-Akrofonso is a town in the Sekyere South District of the Ashanti Region of Ghana, West Africa. Agona-Akrofonso is approximately 38 kilometres (24mi) north-east of the Ashanti Regional capital, Kumasi,[1] off the Kumasi-Mampong highway. The population of Agona-Akrofonso is estimated to be about 1,600 inhabitants. The geographic coordinates for Agona-Akrofonso in the Sekyere South District of the Ashanti Regions are latitude 655\'15.045"N and longitude 128\'11.9634"W. The people of Agona-Akrofonso are Ashantis, belonging to the Akan clan of Ghana, although other Akan people are found as far away as the Ivory Coast, to the west of Ghana. The people of Akrofonso speak the Twi language, although the language of business, commerce and instruction in educational institutions is English, as in all of Ghana. Agona-Akrofonso is one of only a few places in the old Ashanti Kingdom where Okomfo Anokye, the legendary Chief High Priest and advisor to the King of the Ashanti Nation, visited during the late 17th century, at the height of the Great Wars with the Denkyira people. According to legend, the People of Akrofonso relocated from the original settlement approx. 37 kilometres (23mi) from Kumasi, to the current existing core of the town where there still exist historic buildings needing rehabilitation and preservation. The historic center of Akrofonso was planned in a grid fashion from the start, as has been documented in other cases from historical literature concerned with town planning and urbanization. Other town planning principles can be observed in Akrofonso, at large, including a waste-water collection system, public places of convenience, school buildings that double as community health centers, and protected lands. Since the 1980s, development of Akrofonso has progressed at a faster pace. The housing stock has increased well beyond the historic core, accompanied by an increase in population and urbanization. Efforts to map out the current geographic extent of Akrofonso is needed as part of a desirable town planning effort, for any town of its size and stature. The Akrofosohene Stool (seat of Chieftaincy of Akrofonso) is rightly one of the significant Akan stools from the Ekuona clan and family. Reportedly, the patriarch of the Ekuona is Nana Asante Gyima of Adanse and their totem is the Buffalo (Ekuo), symbolising honesty and uprightness. There are several pending infrastructure, development plans and projects currently being considered or under construction in Akrofonso, including a 60-foot-high (18m) potable water tank with a capacity of over 12,000 US gallons (45,400L). To travel to Agona-Akrofonso from Kumasi, take the Kumasi-Mampong toll road, going north. At the main intersection at Agona market, near the lorry park, take the road going east to Asamang. The Akrofonso water tower is approximately 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the intersection. The public primary school is to the right of the water tower tank, and the old historic part of town is to the west. There are several public water wells all around Akrofonso that are available to the people for a low fee, per bucket. However, many homes have private water wells, and the same applies to toilets. The water tower is being developed through private enterprise and is expected to be completed before June 2012, giving all residents access to a central water source and a potentially better quality/safer water source. Agona-Akrofonso can also boast of a football club known as Multi Stars which currently plays in the third division of the Ghanaian league division. It started with notable players such as Ofori Christian, Brother, Kwabena Bresiamah, R.K., and their first coach was Boadi Nyamekye popularly known as Kapitulate. The local government runs a kindergarten in Agona-Akrofonso that is not always fully attended by all eligible children. There are many reasons for poor attendance, including poor health or parents\' inability to provide supplies, such as shoes, and the need for children to remain at home to help their parents. In addition, there is a primary and middle school called Junior High School. The school\'s buildings were built in 1942,[2] and have received few upgrades. On graduating from the Junior High School, children typically attend one of the secondary schools, called senior high schools, in Sekyere South District, although many leave the area entirely to attend school in Kumasi, Accra, or other big cities and towns in Ghana. Highly recognized schools such as Adisadel College, Prempeh College, Opoku-ware School and St. Louis School are a few to mention. Tertiary-level education in the town is also progressive. After senior high school, some of the students proceed to universities, polytechnics, nursing and teacher training colleges across the globe. Other students may end their educational careers and become farmers, or join an apprentice trades company/group (such as for masons, carpenters, roofers, plumbers, etc.) to learn a trade. Early in 2012, citizens and supporters of Akrofonso began developing plans to develop the town, focusing in part on the Junior High School. Some long-delayed school improvements[3] are now needed to replace the roof, repair load-bearing columns, repair windows, doors, and book shelves, and paint the interior and exterior of the building. In addition, furniture (chairs and tables) is needed. Future phases will address potable water needs, hand-washing stations and a new school fence. In other cases, young people who leave Akrofonso travel overseas to countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, etc. Consequently, there is a growing number of native Ghanaian diasporans from Agona-Akrofonso all over the world. Many make frequent financial and other remittances to family members, and often visit. This allows for individuals and their families to maintain crucial contacts, including business and educational relations, and sponsorship of construction projects all over Akrofonso and in the nearby towns (Agona, Asamang, Jamasi, etc.). Agona-Akrofonso is on the Ghana National Electricity Grid,[4] and many homes have electricity. Cocoa production[5] is the primary occupation. However, the production of food commodities (yams, cassava, poultry, plantains, cocoyams, fruits, etc.) is also important to the local economy. Starting from 2012, some of the local teenagers also are involved in mining activities across mining centers in the country. Coordinates: 824N 134W / 8.400N 1.567W / 8.400; -1.567'

aS'The Kempeitai East District Branch was the headquarters of the Kempeitai, the Japanese military police, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore from 1942 to 1945. It was located at the old YMCA building, at the present site of Singapore\'s YMCA on Stamford Road. Opened in 1911, the distinctive Art Deco YMCA building was the site of interrogation and torture of many innocent civilians, including the war heroine Elizabeth Choy. After the war, the Singapore government erected several memorials with some at the former massacre sites. In 1995, the former site of the old YMCA building was gazetted by the National Heritage Board as one of the eleven World War II sites of Singapore.[1] The Kempeitai was formed as a semi-autonomous unit on 4 January 1881 by order of the Meiji Council of State.[2] Its brief covered military discipline, law and order, intelligence and subversion, as well as policing thoughts in the civilian population.[3] Their political influence increased when Hideki Tojo became the Vice-Minister of War in the 1930s. From 1895 to 1945, the Kempeitai built up a large network of influence in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which refers to Japanese-occupied territories in Asia during World War II. All prisoners-of-war (POW) and POW camps came under the control of the Kempeitai, as did \'comfort women\' and comfort houses.[3] Kempeitai officers were trained at special training schools, with the main ones being in Tokyo and Keijo (now Seoul) in Korea. Kempei were trained to conduct espionage, weaponry, code-breaking, running spy networks and other subversive activities during a year long course. Kempeitai personnel were dressed in the standard Japanese military uniform, but they were distinguished by an armband bearing the Japanese characters for Kempeitai (). They also wore khaki uniforms with an armband or were simply dressed in civilian clothes. While officers were armed with shin gunt and a pistol, non-commissioned officers often carried a bamboo stick split at the ends to make it pliable and to increase the pain felt by a person hit by it.[3] The Kempeitai made use of informers and recruited spies from within the community, and encouraged the giving of information with rewards and privileges in return. Many of these informers had dubious backgrounds  secret society members, gangsters, prostitutes and those of other races with criminal records who were obliged to provide information to save themselves from torture or execution.[4] As a result, many innocent people were taken away mysteriously and an atmosphere of distrust and fear ruled life during the Japanese occupation. In Syonan (as Singapore was called during the Japanese occupation), the Kempeitai came under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of War in Tokyo. It was led by Oishi Masayuki, with his headquarters at the old YMCA, which also served as the East District Branch. There were about 200 regular Kempeitai in Singapore but 1,000 auxiliaries were recruited from the army.[2] The Kempeitai jail was in Outram, with branches in Stamford Road, Chinatown, and the Central Police Station. A former residence at Smith Street in Chinatown formed the Kempeitai West District Branch.[2] The YMCA also served as a prison for people suspected of being anti-Japanese. Typically, prisoners were cramped into small cells and forced to be motionless and absolutely silent.[5] Those arrested would be tortured for the purpose of extracting names of anti-Japanese accomplices from them; refusal to offer such names led to further punishment. Should a prisoner surrender under the torment, any person identified by him as a "subversive force" would be sentenced to death or imprisonment.[5] The Kempeitai believed that a person suspected of committing a crime had to prove his innocence, but was given no opportunity to do so. Pain and threats to life were standard methods of interrogation used by the Kempeitai to obtain a \'confession\'.[4] Called "treatments" by the Kempeitai, some that were described by victims and witnesses during the Singapore Chinese Massacre Trial in 1947 were:[4] After the "treatment" was meted out, those who had \'confessed\' to minor crimes were sentenced to imprisonment, while others were summarily executed. After the British surrender on 15 February 1942, the heads of looters were displayed on stakes outside the Kempeitai Headquarters and Cathay Buildingused by the Japanese Military Propagation Department -- [6] as a deterrent to looting and gruesome reminder of its power.[7] Rudy Mosbergen, a former principal of Raffles Institution, wrote in a book, In The Grip of A Crisis (2007), about his life as a teenager during the Japanese occupation, during which he witnessed the following scene at the Cathay Building: During the early days of the Japanese occupation, an extensive clean-up operation to purge anti-Japanese elementsincluding former members of Dalforce, Force 136, and supporters of the China Relief Fundknown as Sook Ching was undertaken. The massacres were executed under the supervision of the Kempeitai with the Hojo Kempei ("auxiliary military police") being employed to carry out the actual shooting under orders of a Kempeitai officer. Although the exact figures will never be fully known, it was estimated that a total figure between 25,000 and 50,000 victims were massacred according to the post-war trial testimonies in 1947.[9] Masanobu Tsuji was identified by Japanese army commanders as the man responsible for the Sook Ching massacre during the Singapore Chinese Massacre Trial in 1947.[10] Tsuji was appointed as the Chief Planning and Operations Officer of the 25th Army, which was led by Tomoyuki Yamashita during the Malayan Campaign. He had close links with the Imperial Headquarters in Tokyo and enjoyed certain privileges that officers of more senior ranks were not allowed.[10] Overstepping his authority, he had issued orders during the massacre of thousands of Chinese civilians in Singapore and Malaya with Yamashita\'s knowledge but without his approval. He was also responsible for the slaughter of thousands of American and Filipino prisoners-of-war in the Philippines.[11] Tsuji was in Myanmar at the time of Japan\'s unconditional surrender to British forces in August 1946 and made his getaway to Thailand disguised as a wandering Buddhist monk. He later spent a short spell in China during its the Chinese Civil War. He was pursued by the British but they were unable to get him, as he was sheltered by the United States for political reasons when he resurfaced in Japan in 1947.[11] He was cleared of any war crimes in 1950 and later became one of Japan\'s most prominent post-war parliamentarians.[11] In 1961, Tsuji disappeared mysteriously in Indochina and was officially declared dead in 1968.[12] After the war, only seven men were charged for their alleged role in Sook Ching in 1947:[13] Kawamura and Oishi received the death sentence while the remaining five were given life sentences but served just five years until 1952, when Japan regained its sovereignty.[13] Plans to rebuild the YMCA premises began in 1969 and the new YMCA building was officially opened on 24 November 1984.[14] The old YMCA building has since been demolished in 1981, for which Elizabeth Choy was very grateful. Choy was detained and tortured at YMCA for nearly 200 days for her crime of "being pro-British and anti-Japanese" during the Double Tenth Incident inquisition.[15] She said: Her tormentor, a Kempeitai warrant officer called Monai Tadamori, was sentenced to death by a military court after the war.[15] To keep alive the memory of the Japanese occupation and its lessons learnt for future generations, the Singapore government erected several memorials with some at the former massacre sites: Spearheaded and managed by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Civilian War Memorial is located in the War Memorial Park at Beach Road. Comprising four white concrete columns, this 61 metres tall memorial commemorates the civilian dead of all races. It was built after thousands of remains were discovered all over Singapore during the urban redevelopment boom in the early 1960s. The memorial was officially unveiled by Singapore\'s first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew on the 25th anniversary of the start of the Japanese occupation in 1967.[16] It was constructed with part of the S$50 million \'blood debt\' compensation paid by the Japanese government in October 1966.[16] Speaking at the unveiling ceremony, Lee said: On 15 February every year, memorial services (opened to the public) are held at the memorial. The site of this monument lies within the compound of Hong Lim Complex in Chinatown. The inscription on the monument reads: On 18 February 1942, three days after the surrender of Singapore, the Kempeitai launched a month-long purge of \'anti-Japanese elements\' in an operation named Sook Ching. All Chinese men between 18 and 50 years old, and in some cases women and children, were ordered to report to these temporary registration centres for interrogation and identification by the Kempeitai. Those who passed the arbitrary screening were released with \'Examined\' stamped on their faces, arms or clothes. Others not so fortunate were taken to outlying parts of Singapore and executed for alleged anti-Japanese activities. Tens of thousands were estimated to have lost their lives. For those who were spared, the Sook Ching screening remains one of their worst memories of the Japanese Occupation.\n National Heritage Board.[17] The site of this monument is located in Changi Beach Park (near Camp Site 2) in the eastern part of Singapore.

aS"The Archdiocese of Trnava (Slovak: Trnavsk arcidiecza, Latin: Archidioecesis Tyrnaviensis) is a Roman Catholic archdiocese in western Slovakia including bigger part of the Trnava, and parts of Nitra and Trenn regions. It has its seat in Trnava. On July 11, 2013, Pope Francis appointed Auxiliary Bishop Jn Orosch as the next Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Trnava. Orosch had been serving as a Titular Bishop and as the Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese, which was a vacant see (sede vacante) following the resignation of Archbishop Bezk in 2012. Archbishop Orosch was born on May 28, 1953, in Bratislava, Slovakia. He prepared for the priesthood, studying undergraduate Philosophy and graduate Theology, at the Major Seminary of the then-Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava, where he was ordained for the Catholic priesthood, on June 6, 1976. He was the Parochial Vicar (Associate Pastor) at the Parish in Komnarno, Slovakia (1976-1978). In the years from 1978 to 1990, he was Pastor of the Parishes in Buince, Slovakia, Oko, Slovakia, Hodrua-Hmre, Slovakia, and Vykovce nad Ipl'om, Slovakia. Subsequently, from 1990 to 2004, he was Pastor of the Parishes in Nov Zmky, Slovakia, Prievoz, Slovakia, Cunovo, Slovakia, and Strovo, Slovakia. Then, on April 2, 2004, Archbishop Orosch was appointed by Blessed Pope John Paul II as an Auxiliary Bishop of the then-Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava. On May 2, 2004, he received episcopal ordination as an Auxiliary Bishop. In 2008, with the creation of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Trnava by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, he became an Auxiliary Bishop there. On July 2, 2012 he was appointed Apostolic Administrator by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI due to the resignation of the Archbishop of Trnava.[1] The diocese was first created as Apostolic Administration of Trnava on 29 May 1922, subordinate to the Archdiocese of Esztergom. On the order of Pope Paul VI on 30 December 1977, it was separated from the former, elevated to the status of diocese and renamed to the Archdiocese of Trnava, and it had at first suffragans of Nitra, Bansk Bystrica, Roava, Koice and Spi. On 31 March 1995, the archdiocese was renamed to Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava, and since then it had only suffragans of Bansk Bystrica and Nitra. Its territory covered Bratislava, Trnava, Nitra (except the city of Nitra and the strip connecting it with the main part of the Diocese of Nitra), small part of the Trenn and south-western part of the Bansk Bystrica regions. As of 2004, it covered an area of approximately 14,000km with a population of 1,930,000 people of which around 70% were of Catholic faith.[2] On 14 February 2008, the archdiocese was split between several dioceses. Trnava became seat of the newly-created Archdiocese of Trnava, which, despite being an archdiocese, belongs to the ecclesiastical province of Bratislava as its suffragan. Other parts of the former diocese have been split between the dioceses of Nitra and Bansk Bystrica (see e.g. this map (in Slovak). Rbert Bezk, C.SS.R. (a member of the Redemptorist order) served as Archbishop from 2009. In January 2012, the Vatican had named the Czech bishop Jan Baxant as its apostolic visitor to the archdiocese of Trnava. Archbishop Bezk's removal from this see was announced July 2, 2012.[citation needed] "

aS'The Twenty-fifth Amendment was a failed attempt to amend the Constitution of Ireland to tighten the constitutional ban on abortion. It would have removed the threat of suicide as a grounds for legal abortion in the state, as well as introducing new penalties for anyone performing an abortion.[1] It was narrowly rejected in the 2002 abortion referendum. The full title of the proposal was the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001. After it was rejected the number 25 was not reused; instead the next successful amendment of the constitution was entitled the "Twenty-sixth Amendment". There has therefore officially been no successfully enacted "Twenty-fifth Amendment" of the Irish constitution. In 1983 the Eighth Amendment introduced a constitutional ban on abortion in Ireland. The "X Case" in 1992 established the right of Irish women to an abortion if a pregnant woman\'s life was at risk because of pregnancy, including the risk of suicide. Following the X Case, three separate constitutional amendments on the subject of abortion were put to a vote in the 1992 abortion referendums. One proposed to tighten the law on abortion. This was the Twelfth Amendment, which proposed that the possibility of suicide was not a sufficient threat to justify an abortion, but was rejected. Two other amendments proposed to liberalise the law in certain ways and were approved. These were the Thirteenth Amendment, which guaranteed freedom of travel to obtain an abortion abroad, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed freedom of speech with respect to the issue. The Twenty-fifth Amendment was a second attempt to tighten the law on abortion following the rejection of the Twelfth Amendment in 1992. It was introduced by the Fianna FilProgressive Democrats coalition government of Bertie Ahern. The government presented the amendment as one part of a comprehensive package of changes to address the issue of crisis pregnancy.[2] Among other measures it would have removed the threat of suicide as a grounds for legal abortion and also would have introduced new penalties of up to twelve years in jail, for those performing or assisting abortions. Along with the government parties, the Catholic Church favoured the proposal, it was opposed by Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn Fin. The proposal was put to a referendum on 6 March 2002 but was narrowly rejected by 629,041 (50.4%) against to 618,485 (49.6%) in favour. The Twenty-fifth Amendment was much more complex than the proposal that had been rejected in 1992. As well as adding new text to the constitution it proposed to introduce a complete code for regulating the law on abortion. The government did not wish to include this lengthy code in the text of constitution, rather it was to take the form of an Act of the Oireachtas, called the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act, 2002. This Act would be mentioned in the constitution and given special protection, so that in future it could only be amended by referendum. The Twenty-fifth Amendment was intended to add the following provisions to the constitution: The Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act would, among other provisions, have It was intended that the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act would be enacted by the Oireachtas only after the Twenty-fifth Amendment had come into force. This meant that the Amendment was a complex piece of legislation. It proposed to insert a number of temporary provisions in the constitution to bridge the period between the enactment of the Twenty-fifth Amendment and the subsequent enacted of the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act. The Twenty-fifth Amendment proposed first of all to add a temporary section to the constitution called Article 46.5. This section provided that the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act had to be enacted within 180 days. Once this occurred Article 46.5 would be deleted and two permanent provisions would be added: Article 40.3.4 and Article 40.3.5. The temporary Article 46.5 provided that if no action was taken within 180 days then the whole constitutional amendment would lapse. It also stated that the bill for the Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy Act could not be referred by the President of Ireland to the Supreme Court or to an ordinary referendum. The proposed amendment was called the "Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy) Bill, 2001" because an earlier proposal called the "Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2001" had already been introduced. This was as a private member\'s bill by Caoimhghn  Caolin to guarantee Irish neutrality. It had lapsed after its first reading but the existence of that bill necessitated the inclusion of the parenthetical qualification "(Protection of Human Life in Pregnancy)" in the name of the later bill.[3] The result of the referendum showed a strong rural-urban divide. The urban constituencies Cork North Central and Cork South Central voted "no" along with all Dublin city and county constituencies, the commuter-heavy Kildare constituencies and Wicklow, Galway West, Limerick East and Waterford. All other constituencies recorded a "yes" vote. The strongest "no" vote was in Dun Laoghaire where 68% of voters were against the proposed amendment. The strongest "yes" was in Donegal North East which recorded a 70% vote in favour of the amendment.'

aS'Berkelium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with the symbol Bk and atomic number 97, a member of the actinide and transuranium element series. It is named after the city of Berkeley, California, the location of the University of California Radiation Laboratory where it was discovered in December 1949. This was the fifth transuranium element discovered after neptunium, plutonium, curium and americium. The major isotope of berkelium, berkelium-249, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux nuclear reactors, mainly at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, and at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. The production of the second-important isotope berkelium-247 involves the irradiation of the rare isotope curium-244 with high-energy alpha particles. Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier transuranic elements and transactinides. A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the element ununseptium for the first time in 2009 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Russia, after it was bombarded with calcium-48 ions for 150 days. This was a culmination of the RussiaUS collaboration on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118. Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy electrons and thus is relatively safe to handle. However, it decays with a half-life of 330days to californium-249, which is a strong and hazardous emitter of alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also self-radiation damage, and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles. Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive actinide metal. In the periodic table, it is located to the right of the actinide curium, to the left of the actinide californium and below the lanthanide terbium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78g/cm3 lies between those of curium (13.52g/cm3) and californium (15.1g/cm3), as does its melting point of 986C, below that of curium (1340C) but higher than that of californium (900C).[1] Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest bulk moduli among the actinides, at about 20 GPa (21010Pa).[2] Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp fluorescence peaks at 652nanometers (red light) and 742nanometers (deep red  near infrared) due to internal transitions at the f-electron shell. The relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.[3][4] Between 70K and room temperature, berkelium behaves as a CurieWeiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (B) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of 9.72B calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state.[5] Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is 600kJ/mol1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (fH) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as 601kJ/mol1. The standard potential Bk3+/Bk0 is 2.01V.[6] The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.[7] At ambient conditions, berkelium assumes its most stable  form which has a hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with -lanthanum and -forms of actinides beyond curium.[8] This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, -berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fm3m. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol.[9] Upon further compression to 25GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic -berkelium structure similar to that of -uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f electron shell.[10] No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.[2][11] Upon heating, -berkelium transforms into another phase with an fcc lattice (but slightly different from -berkelium), space group Fm3m and the lattice constant of 500pm; this fcc structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original -berkelium phase at room temperature.[8] The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.[12][13][14] Like all actinides, berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous hydrogen and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This trivalent oxidation state (+3) is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but tetravalent (+4) and possibly divalent (+2) berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts.[15][16] A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, terbium.[17] Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid.[15][18][19] Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals, hydrogen, halogens, chalcogens and pnictogens to form various binary compounds.[5][12] About twenty isotopes and six nuclear isomers (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the atomic numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All of them are radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (9 years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft -particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak  1.45103% with respect to the -radiation  but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.[20][21] All berkelium isotopes have a half-life far too short to be primordial. Therefore, all primordial berkelium, that is, berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. On Earth, berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas, which were used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.[22] Nuclear reactors produce mostly, among the berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage and before the fuel disposal, most of it beta decays to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long when compared to the other isotopes produced in the reactor,[23] and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products. A few atoms of berkelium can be produced by neutron capture reactions and beta decay in very highly concentrated uranium-bearing deposits, thus making it the rarest naturally occurring element.[24] Although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was first intentionally synthesized, isolated and identified in December 1949 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso and Stanley G. Thompson. They used the 60-inch cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of americium (element 95) and curium (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and californium (element 98) were both produced in 19491950.[17][25][26][27] The name choice for element 97 followed the previous tradition of the Californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered actinide and the lanthanide element positioned above it in the periodic table. Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue europium, and curium honored scientists Marie and Pierre Curie as the lanthanide above it, gadolinium, was named after the explorer of the rare earth elements Johan Gadolin. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: "It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue terbium (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of Ytterby, Sweden, where the rare earth minerals were first found."[26] This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, californium, was not related to its lanthanide analogue dysprosium, but after the discovery place.[28] The most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium (241Am) nitrate solution was coated on a platinum foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to americium dioxide (AmO2). This target was irradiated with 35MeV alpha particles for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The (,2n) reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the 243Bk isotope and two free neutrons:[26] After the irradiation, the coating was dissolved with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous ammonia solution. The product was centrifugated and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution was added to a mixture of ammonium and ammonium sulfate and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the oxidation state +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of hydrofluoric acid as americium(III) fluoride (AmF\n3). This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with potassium hydroxide, and after centrifugation, was dissolved in perchloric acid.[26] Further separation was carried out in the presence of a citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperature. The chromatographic separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for characteristic X-rays and conversion electron signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its mass number was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report,[17] but was later established as 243.[26] Berkelium is produced by bombarding lighter actinides uranium (238U) or plutonium (239Pu) with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. In a more common case of uranium fuel, plutonium is produced first by neutron capture (the so-called (n,) reaction or neutron fusion) followed by beta-decay:[29] Plutonium-239 is further irradiated by a source that has a high neutron flux, several times higher than a conventional nuclear reactor, such as the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA. The higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons, converting 239Pu to 244Cm and then to 249Cm: Curium-249 has a short half-life of 64 minutes, and thus its further conversion to 250Cm has a low probability. Instead, it transforms by beta-decay into 249Bk:[21] The thus-produced 249Bk has a long half-life of 330 days and thus can capture another neutron. However, the product, 250Bk, again has a relatively short half-life of 3.212 hours and thus, does not yield any heavier berkelium isotopes. Instead decays to the californium isotope 250Cf:[30][31] Although 247Bk is the most stable isotope of berkelium, its production in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, 249Bk is the most accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66grams have been produced in the US over the period 19671983[32]) at a high price of the order 185 USD per microgram.[1] The isotope 248Bk was first obtained in 1956 by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with 25 MeV -particles. Although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with 245Bk, the existence of a new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product 248Cf which had been previously characterized. The half-life of 248Cf was estimated as 23  5 hours and a more reliable value still is not known.[33] Berkelium-247 was produced during the same year by irradiating 244Cm with alpha-particles:[34] Berkelium-242 was synthesized in 1979 by bombarding 235U with 11B, 238U with 10B, 232Th with 14N or 232Th with 15N. It converts by electron capture to 242Cm with a half-life of 7.0  1.3 minutes. A search for an initially suspected isotope 241Bk was then unsuccessful;[35] 241Bk has since been synthesized.[36] The fact that berkelium readily assumes oxidation state +4 in solids, and is relatively stable in this state in liquids greatly assists separation of berkelium away from many other actinides. These are inevitably produced in relatively large amounts during the nuclear synthesis and often favor the +3 state. This fact was not yet known in the initial experiments, which used a more complex separation procedure. Various oxidation agents can be applied to the berkelium(III) solutions to convert it to the +4 state, such as bromates (BrO\n3), bismuthates (BiO\n3), chromates (CrO2\n4 and Cr\n2O2\n7), silver(I) thiolate (Ag\n2S\n2O\n8), lead(IV) oxide (PbO\n2), ozone (O\n3), or photochemical oxidation procedures. Berkelium(IV) is then extracted with ion exchange, extraction chromatography or liquid-liquid extraction using HDEHP (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric scid), amines, tributyl phosphate or various other reagents. These procedures separate berkelium from most trivalent actinides and lanthanides, except for the lanthanide cerium (lanthanides are absent in the irradiation target but are created in various nuclear fission decay chains).[37] A more detailed procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted using one of the procedures described above.[37] Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.[38] In order to characterize chemical and physical properties of solid berkelium and its compounds, a program was initiated in 1952 at the Material Testing Reactor, Arco, Idaho, US. It resulted in preparation of an eight-gram plutonium-239 target and in the first production of macroscopic quantities (0.6micrograms) of berkelium by Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thompson in 1958, after a continuous reactor irradiation of this target for six years.[32][39] This irradiation method was and still is the only way of producing weighable amounts of the element, and most solid-state studies of berkelium have been conducted on microgram or submicrogram-sized samples.[12][40] The world\'s major irradiation sources are the 85-megawatt High Flux Isotope Reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA,[41] and the SM-2 loop reactor at the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Russia,[42] which are both dedicated to the production of transcurium elements (atomic number greater than 96). These facilities have similar power and flux levels, and are expected to have comparable production capacities for transcurium elements,[43] although the quantities produced at NIIAR are not publicly reported. In a "typical processing campaign" at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium-249 and einsteinium, and picogram quantities of fermium.[44][45] In total, just over one gram of berkelium-249 has been produced at Oak Ridge since 1967.[12] The first berkelium metal sample weighing 1.7micrograms was prepared in 1971 by the reduction of berkelium(III) fluoride with lithium vapor at 1000C; the fluoride was suspended on a tungsten wire above a tantalum crucible containing molten lithium. Later, metal samples weighting up to 0.5milligrams were obtained with this method.[8][46] Similar results are obtained with berkelium(IV) fluoride.[10] Berkelium metal can also be produced by the reduction of berkelium(IV) oxide with thorium or lanthanum.[46][47] Two oxides of berkelium are known, with the berkelium oxidation state of +3 (Bk2O3) and +4 (BkO2).[48] Berkelium(IV) oxide is a brown solid,[49] while berkelium(III) oxide is a yellow-green solid with a melting point of 1920 C[50][49] and is formed from BkO2 by reduction with molecular hydrogen: Upon heating to 1200 C, the oxide Bk2O3 undergoes a phase change; it undergoes another phase change at 1750 C. Such three-phase behavior is typical for the actinide sesquioxides. Berkelium(II) oxide, BkO, has been reported as a brittle gray solid but its exact chemical composition remains uncertain.[51] In halides, berkelium assumes the oxidation states +3 and +4.[52] The +3 state is the most stable, especially in solutions, while the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only known in the solid phase.[53] The coordination of berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with the coordination number of 9. In trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic (coordination 8) or octahedral (coordination 6),[54] and in the iodide it is octahedral.[55] Berkelium(IV) fluoride (BkF4) is a yellow-green ionic solid and is isotypic with uranium tetrafluoride or zirconium(IV) fluoride.[56][58][59] Berkelium(III) fluoride (BkF3) is also a yellow-green solid, but it has two crystalline structures. The most stable phase at low temperatures is isotypic with yttrium(III) fluoride, while upon heating to between 350 and 600 C, it transforms to the structure found in lanthanum(III) fluoride.[56][58][60] Visible amounts of berkelium(III) chloride (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It can be prepared by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature about 500C.[61] This green solid has a melting point of 600 C,[52] and is isotypic with uranium(III) chloride.[62][63] Upon heating to nearly melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase.[64] Two forms of berkelium(III) bromide are known: one with berkelium having coordination 6, and one with coordination 8.[40] The latter is less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied on these two crystal forms: the structure of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples was probed by X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of berkelium-249 had beta decayed to californium-249. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3249CfBr3 transformation. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to 249CfBr2, but the former could not  this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both bromides.[54] The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs at a rate of 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties. Beside a chemical contamination, 249Cf, being an alpha emitter, brings undesirable self-damage of the crystal lattice and the resulting self-heating. The chemical effect however can be avoided by performing measurements as a function of time and extrapolating the obtained results.[53] The pnictides of berkelium-249 of the type BkX are known for the elements nitrogen,[65] phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They crystallize in the rock-salt structure and are prepared by the reaction of either berkelium(III) hydride (BkH3) or metallic berkelium with these elements at elevated temperature (about 600C) under high vacuum.[66] Berkelium(III) sulfide, Bk2S3, is prepared by either treating berkelium oxide with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide vapors at 1130C, or by directly reacting metallic berkelium with elemental sulfur. These procedures yield brownish-black crystals.[67] Berkelium(III) and berkelium(IV) hydroxides are both stable in 1 molar solutions of sodium hydroxide. Berkelium(III) phosphate (BkPO4) has been prepared as a solid, which shows strong fluorescence under excitation with a green light.[68] Berkelium hydrides are produced by reacting metal with hydrogen gas at temperatures about 250 C.[65] They are non-stoichiometric with the nominal formula BkH2+x (0 < x < 1).[67] Several other salts of berkelium are known, including an oxysulfide (Bk2O2S), and hydrated nitrate (Bk(NO\n3)\n34H\n2O), chloride (BkCl\n36H\n2O), sulfate (Bk\n2(SO\n4)\n312H\n2O) and oxalate (Bk\n2(C\n2O\n4)\n34H\n2O).[53] Thermal decomposition at about 600 C in an argon atmosphere (to avoid oxidation to BkO\n2) of Bk\n2(SO\n4)\n312H\n2O yields the crystals of berkelium(III) oxysulfate (Bk\n2O\n2SO\n4). This compound is thermally stable to at least 1000 C in inert atmosphere.[69] Berkelium forms a trigonal (5C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex with three cyclopentadienyl rings, which can be synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with the molten beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250C, and sublimates without melting at about 350C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks).[61][70] One cyclopentadienyl ring in (5C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield [Bk(C5H5)2Cl]2. The optical absorption spectra of this compound are very similar to those of (5C5H5)3Bk.[46][69] There is currently no use for any isotope of berkelium outside of basic scientific research.[12] Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium.[12] It is also useful as a source of the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.[12][72] A 22milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared in a 250-day irradiation and then purified for 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This target yielded the first 6 atoms of ununseptium at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), Dubna, Russia, after bombarding it with calcium ions in the U400 cyclotron for 150 days. This synthesis was a culmination of the RussiaUS collaboration between JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory on the synthesis of elements 113 to 118 which was initiated in 1989.[73][74] The nuclear fission properties of berkelium are different from those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture cross section of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission cross section for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250.[75][76][77] In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor. Its critical mass is relatively high at 192kg; it can be reduced with a water or steel reflector but would still exceed the world production of this isotope.[78] Berkelium-247 can maintain chain reaction both in a thermal-neutron and in a fast-neutron reactor, however, its production is rather complex and thus the availability is much lower than its critical mass, which is about 75.7kg for a bare sphere, 41.2kg with a water reflector and 35.2kg with a steel reflector (30cm thickness).[78] Little is known about the effects of berkelium on human body, and analogies with other elements may not be drawn because of different radiation products (electrons for berkelium and alpha particles, neutrons, or both for most other actinides). The low energy of electrons emitted from berkelium-249 (less than 126 keV) hinders its detection, due to signal interference with other decay processes, but also makes this isotope relatively harmless to humans as compared to other actinides. However, berkelium-249 transforms with a half-life of only 330 days to the strong alpha-emitter californium-249, which is rather dangerous and has to be handled in a glove box in a dedicated laboratory.[79] Most available berkelium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium ends in the blood stream. From there, about 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted.[80] In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.[1][81] '

aS'Filth is the debut studio album by American post-punk band Swans. It was released in 1983, following their self-titled debut EP, through record label Neutral. Only band leader and vocalist Michael Gira and drummer Jonathan Kane remained from the original lineup. This is the first Swans release to feature the experimental and noisy playing style that the band\'s early work would become known for. The album\'s distinct sound is partly the product of a new lineup featuring two drummers (Roli Mosimann and Kane). It also marks the first appearance of future Swans regular Norman Westberg. Rock critic Piero Scaruffi described the album as "the ideal soundtrack for mass suicides or nuclear holocausts. Gira\'s agonizing roars echoed against a wall of sound as brutal as hardcore, as depressed as Joy Division, as strident as industrial music, as distorted as psychedelic rock, as loud as heavy metal."[1] All lyrics written by Michael Gira,all music composed by Swans (Gira, Jonathan Kane, Roli Mosimann, Norman Westberg, Harry Crosby). The 1990 CD and audio tape releases featured the four tracks from Swans\' first EP as bonus tracks. The 1990 vinyl re-release preserved the original nine-song track listing. The double CD re-release in 2000 on Gira\'s label Young God Records (paired with Body to Body, Job to Job) included a 1982/1983 live set from The Kitchen in New York City. This 24:18 long extra track consisted of the songs "Strip/Burn", "Heatsheet", "Blackout", "Clay Man", "Stay Here" and "Weakling". The tracks from the first EP were not included. In their retrospective review, AllMusic wrote, "early Swans really is like little else on the planet before or since."[2]'

aS'"Bright Lights, Big City" is a classic blues song[1] which was written and first recorded by American bluesman Jimmy Reed[2] in 1961. Besides being "an integral part of the standard blues repertoire",[3] "Bright Lights, Big City" has appealed to a variety of artists, including country and rock musicians, who have recorded their interpretations of the song. Called a "textbook Jimmy and Mama Reed duet",[4] "Bright Lights, Big City" was a collaborative writing effort between Reed and his wife, Mary "Mama" Reed. It is a cautionary tale about urban life: The song has a traditional twelve-bar blues form in Reed\'s signature "steady-rolling style".[5] It was recorded in Chicago in 1961 with Jimmy Reed (vocal and harmonica), Mama Reed (vocal), Jimmy Reed, Jr. (guitar), Lefty Bates (guitar), Earl Phillips (drums), and an unidentified bassist. The song was one of Reed\'s most popular songs and reached number three in the Billboard R&B chart as well as number fifty-eight in the pop Hot 100.[6] "Bright Lights, Big City" was included on the album Jimmy Reed at Carnegie Hall and appears on many Reed compilations. American country music singer Sonny James recorded "Bright Lights, Big City" in 1971. An early review included: "Jimmy Reed\'s blues number serves as strong material for the Southern Gentleman both vocally and for some exceptional guitar work".[8] The song became James\' fifteenth number-one hit in a row in the country chart as well as reaching number ninety-one in the pop chart.[9] The song is included on James\' 1971 album The Sensational Sonny James and several of his compilation albums. Jimmy Red\'s "Bright Lights, Big City" is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of "500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll".[12] A variety of artists have performed and/or recorded the song, some examples including:[13] The Animals, Bob Dylan, Half Japanese, Them, Johnny Winter, and Neil Young.'

aS'The practice of slavery in Chad, as in the Sahel states in general, is an entrenched phenomenon with a long history, going back to the Arab slave trade in the Sahelian kingdoms, and it continues today. As elsewhere in West Africa, the situation reflects an ethnic, racial and religious rift between black, Christian farmers and lighter-skinned, Muslim herdsmen, occasionally flaring up in eruptions of violence or civil unrest. In the early 1890s, French military expeditions sent to Chad encountered the forces of Rabih az-Zubayr, who had been conducting slave raids (razzias) in southern Chad throughout the 1890s and had sacked the settlements of Bornu, Baguirmi, and Ouaddai. After years of indecisive engagements, French forces finally defeated Rabih az-Zubayr at the battle of Koussri in 1900. The colonial authorities of French Chad officially suppressed slavery, but their de-facto control over the region was limited. In the huge Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, the handful of French military administrators soon reached a tacit agreement with the inhabitants of the desert; as long as caravan trails remained relatively secure and minimal levels of law and order were met, the military administration (headquartered in Faya Largeau) usually left the people alone. In central Chad, French rule was only slightly more substantive. Slave raids continued in the 1920s, and it was reported in 1923 that a group of Senegalese Muslims on their way to Mecca had been seized and sold into slavery. Unwilling to expend the resources required for effective administration, the French government responded with sporadic coercion and a growing reliance on indirect rule through the sultanates. Today, in the Republic of Chad, slavery persists, but it does not have the same ubiquity as in the western Sahel, e.g. in Mauritania where up to 20% of total population are estimated as living in slavery. Instead, contemporary slavery in Chad is mostly limited to child labour, and not to hereditary servitude. Child slaves, sold by their impoverished parents, are mostly held by Arab-Berber herdsmen. These often impose a new identity on them,'

The film stars Erin Cahill (Power Rangers: Time Force) and Canadian actor Andrew Walker (Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, Maybe It's Me). The film was shot in English, with American, British, Canadian, French, and German actors, on location in Berlin, Germany. Cars for the film were supplied by BMW, Audi, and Subaru. It aired first on ProSiebenSat1 in February 2008, and was released theatrically in China by Beijing Time Entertainment. The film has been broadcast on television and released on DVD in dozens of countries, and it was released on DVD in the United States by Maverick Entertainment Group. For four young people; Katie, Mike, Eric, Nicole; speed is a way of life. But the four soon come to realize that living life in the fast lane carries a very high price. On the streets debts are not settled with cash, they are settled in blood. Each character has a different motive and a different goal but when they get behind the wheel they are all the same. It is the speed that connects them, but the one thing they all have in common will be the one thing that tears them apart. The movie starts with bank giving Katie(Owner of Carl's Garage) warning about the debt on her garage. They then order pizza for lunch which is to be delivered by Mike, a pizza delivery guy. On his way to delivery his way is blocked by Nicole's broken down car and then by a police chase between Eric(a police officer) and Wolf (bank robbers wheel man) making him run out of time for delivering pizzas on time. On the roads Katie's Subaru is driven by a mysterious Phantom driver in the illegal racing events thereby earning her extra money for paying her debts. Meanwhile in garage Mike sees Nicole's BMW which he steals to prove he is a good racer to Katie by participating and winning in illegal racing. There he races against Wolf and ultimately wins the race but wrecks the BMW. Next day when Nicole sees what has become of her husband's car, Mike apologizes saying that a car can be fixed but one can't buy what it feels like after winning. This earns Katie Nicole's contract for building her a luxury sports car. Meanwhile Mike is hired by Gargolov(a crime lord) as a wheel man in place of Wolf. Eric is investigating the bank robberies and figures out that Wolf is the former wheel man of Gargolov and also comes to know that Mike is the new one. He investigates Mike's background and comes to know that he is a wanted convict. As ordered Nicole's new sports car is made by Katie on which Mike teaches her how to race, drive and drift. In the proceeding later Mike and Eric becomes friends and races against Wolf for the last time where Wolf's car crashes at the end of the race thereby killing him."

aS'The Helvetii were a Gallic[2] tribe or tribal confederation[3] occupying most of the Swiss plateau at the time of their contact with the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. According to Julius Caesar, the Helvetians were divided into four subgroups or pagi. Of these Caesar only names the Verbigeni and the Tigurini,[4] while Poseidonios mentions the Tigurini and the Tygenoi ().[5] They feature prominently in the Commentaries on the Gallic War, with their failed migration attempt to southwestern Gaul (58 BC) serving as a catalyst for Caesar\'s conquest of Gaul. The endonym Helvetii can be derived from the PIE root *pelh1u-[6] "many", Celtic elu-, which is seen in Welsh elw, meaning "gain" or "profit", and the Old Irish prefix il-, meaning "many" or "multiple".[3] The second part of the name has sometimes been interpreted as *etu-, "terrain, grassland", thus interpreting the tribal name as "rich in land".[7] The name of the national personification of Switzerland, Helvetia, and the country\'s Neo-Latin name, Confoederatio Helvetica, are both derived from the name of the Helvetii. Of the four Helvetian pagi or sub-tribes, Caesar only names the Verbigeni (Bell.Gall. 1.27) and the Tigurini (1.12), Poseidonios the Tigurini and the Tygenoi (). The latter may or may not be identical with the Teutones named by Livy.[8] Ancient writers usually classify the Teutons as "Germanic" and the Helvetii as "Gallic", but these ethnic attributions are debatable.[9] According to Caesar, the territory abandoned by the Helvetii had comprised 400 villages and 12 oppida (fortified settlements).[10] His tally of the total population taken from captured Helvetian records written in Greek is 263,000 people, including fighting men, old men, women and children.[11] However, these figures are generally dismissed as too high by modern scholars (see hereafter). Like many other tribes, the Helvetii did not have kings at the time of their clash with Rome but instead seem to have been governed by a class of noblemen (Lat. equites).[12] When Orgetorix, one of their most prominent and ambitious noblemen, was making plans to establish himself as their king, he faced execution by burning if found guilty. Caesar does not explicitly name the tribal authorities prosecuting the case and gathering men to apprehend Orgetorix, but refers to them by the Latin terms civitas ("state" or "tribe") and magistratus ("officials").[13] The name of the Helvetians is first mentioned in a graffito on a vessel from Mantua (c. 300 BC).[14] The inscription in Etruscan letters reads eluveitie, which has been interpreted as the Etruscan form of the Celtic (h)eluetios (the Helvetian), presumably referring to a man of Helvetian descent living in Mantua. In his Natural History (c. 77 AD), Pliny provides a foundation myth for the Celtic settlement of Cisalpine Gaul in which a Helvetian named Helico plays the role of culture hero. Helico had worked in Rome as a craftsman and then returned to his home north of the Alps with a dried fig, a grape, and some oil and wine, the desirability of which caused his countrymen to invade northern Italy.[15] The Greek historian Poseidonios (c. 13550 BC), whose work is preserved only in fragments by other writers, offers the earliest historical record of the Helvetii. Poseidonios described the Helvetians of the late 2nd century BC as "rich in gold but peaceful," without giving clear indication to the location of their territory.[16] His reference to gold washing in rivers has been taken as evidence for an early presence of the Helvetii in the Swiss plateau, with the Emme as being one of the gold-yielding rivers mentioned by Poseidonios. This interpretation is now generally discarded,[17] as Poseidonios\' narrative makes it more likely that the country some of the Helvetians left in order to join in the raids of the Teutones, Cimbri, and Ambrones was in fact southern Germany and not Switzerland. That the Helvetians originally lived in southern Germany is confirmed by the Alexandrian geographer Claudius Ptolemaios (c. 90168 AD), who tells us of an   (i.e. "Helvetic deserted lands") north of the Rhine.[18] Tacitus knows that the Helvetians once settled in the swath between Rhine, Main, and the Hercynian forest.[19] The abandonment of this northern territory is now usually placed in the late 2nd century BC, around the time of the first Germanic incursions into the Roman world, when the Tigurini and Toygenoi/Toutonoi are mentioned as participants in the great raids. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and Ambrones probably reached southern Germany around the year 111 BC, where they were joined by the Tigurini, and, probably the Teutoni-Toutonoi-Toygenoi. (The precise identity of the latter group is unclear.[20]) The tribes began a joint invasion of Gaul, including the Roman Provincia Narbonensis, which led to the Tigurinis victory over a Roman army under L. Cassius Longinus near Agendicum in 107 BC, in which the consul was killed. According to Caesar, the captured Roman soldiers were ordered to pass through under a yoke set up by the triumphant Gauls, a dishonour that called for both public as well as private vengeance.[21] Caesar is the only narrative source for this episode, as the corresponding books of Livys histories are only preserved in the Periochae, short summarising lists of contents, in which hostages given by the Romans, but no yoke, are mentioned.[22] In 105 BC, the allies annihilated another Roman army near Arausio, and went on to harry Spain, Gaul, Noricum, and northern Italy. They split up in two groups in 103 BC, with the Teutones and Ambrones marching on a western route through the Provincia and the Cimbri and Tigurini crossing the eastern Alps (probably by the Brenner pass). While the Teutones and Ambrones were slaughtered in 102 BC by Gaius Marius, the Cimbri and the Tigurini wintered in the Padan plain. The following year, Marius virtually destroyed the Cimbri in the battle of Vercellae. The Tigurini, who had planned on following the Cimbri, turned back over the Alps with their booty and joined those of the Helvetians who had not participated in the raids. The Helvetii were the first Gallic tribe of the campaign to be confronted by Caesar. He narrates the events of the conflict in the opening sections of Commentarii de Bello Gallico.[23] Due to the political nature of the Commentarii, Caesar\'s purpose in publicizing his own achievements may have distorted the significance of events and the motives of those who participated.[24] The nobleman Orgetorix is presented as the instigator of a new Helvetian migration, in which the entire tribe was to leave their territory and, according to Caesar, to establish a supremacy over all of Gaul. This exodus was planned over three years, in the course of which Orgetorix conspired with two noblemen from neighbouring tribes, Casticus of the Sequani and Dumnorix of the Aedui, that each should accomplish a coup d\'etat in his own country, after which the three new kings would collaborate. When word of his aspirations to make himself king reached the Helvetii, Orgetorix was summoned to stand trial, facing execution on the pyre should he be found guilty. For the time being, he averted a verdict by arriving at the hearing set for him with ten thousand followers and bondsmen; yet before the large force mustered by the authorities could apprehend him, he died under unexplained circumstances, the Helvetii believed by his own hand.[25] Nevertheless, the Helvetii did not give up their planned emigration, but burned their homes in 58 BC. They were joined by a number of tribal groups from neighbouring regions: the Raurici, the Latobrigi, the Tulingi and a group of Boii, who had besieged Noreia.[26] They abandoned their homes completely with the intention of settling among the Santones (Saintonge). The easiest route would take them through the Rhne valley, and thus through the Roman Provincia Narbonensis. When they reached the boundaries of the Allobroges, the northernmost tribe of the Provincia, they found that Caesar had already dismantled the bridge of Geneva to stop their advance. The Helvetians sent the most illustrious men of their state to negotiate, promising a peaceful passage through the Provincia. Caesar stalled them by asking for some time for consideration, which he used to assemble reinforcements and to fortify the southern banks of the Rhne. When the embassy returned on the agreed-upon date, he was strong enough to bluntly reject their offer. The Helvetii now chose the more difficult northern route through the Sequani territory, which traversed the Jura Mountains, but bypassed the Provincia. After ravaging the lands of the Aedui tribe, who called upon Caesar to help them, they began the crossing of the Sane, which took them several days. As only a quarter of their forces were left on the eastern banks, Caesar attacked and routed them. According to Caesar, those killed had been the Tigurini, on whom he had now taken revenge in the name of the Republic and his family.[27] After the battle, the Romans quickly bridged the river, thereby prompting the Helvetii to once again send an embassy, this time led by Divico, another figure whom Caesar links to the ignominious defeat of 107 BC by calling him bello Cassio dux Helvetiorum (i.e. leader of the Helvetii in the Cassian campaign). What Divico had to offer was almost a surrender, namely to have the Helvetii settle wherever Caesar wished them to, although it was combined with the threat of an open battle if Caesar should refuse. Caesar demanded hostages to be given to him and reparations to the Aedui and Allobroges. Divico responded by saying that they were accustomed to receive, not to give hostages; a fact the Roman people could testify to,[28] this once again being an allusion to the giving of hostages by the defeated Romans at Agen. In the cavalry battle that followed, the Helvetii prevailed over Caesars Aedui allies under Dumnorix command, and continued their journey, while Caesars army was being detained by delays in his grain supplies, caused by the Aedui on the instigations of Dumnorix, who had married Orgetorix daughter. A few days later, however, near the Aeduan oppidum Bibracte, Caesar caught up with the Helvetii and faced them in a major battle, which ended in the Helvetiis retreat and the capture of most of their baggage by the Romans. Leaving the largest part of their supplies behind, the Helvetii covered around 60km in four days, eventually reaching the lands of the Lingones (the modern Langres plateau). Caesar did not pursue them until three days after the battle, while still sending messengers to the Lingones warning them not to assist the Helvetii in any way. The Helvetii then offered their immediate surrender and agreed both to providing hostages and to giving up their weapons the next day. In the course of the night, 6000 of the Verbigeni fled from the camp out of fear of being massacred once they were defenceless. Caesar sent riders after them and ordered those who were brought back to be counted as enemies, which probably meant being sold into slavery. In order for them to defend the Rhine frontier against the Germans, he then allowed the Helvetii, Tulingi and Latobrigi to return to their territories and to rebuild their homes, instructing the Allobroges to supply them with a sufficient supply of grain. Caesar does not mention the Raurici, who seem to have built a new oppidum at Basel-Mnsterhgel upon their return. The Aedui were granted their wish that the Boii who had accompanied the Helvetii would settle on their own territory as allies in the oppidum Gorgobina. The nature of Caesars arrangement with the Helvetii and the other tribes is not further specified by the consul himself, but in his speech Balbo of 56 BC, Cicero mentions the Helvetii as one among several tribes of foederati, i.e. allied nations who were neither citizens of the Republic nor her subjects, but obliged by treaty to support the Romans with a certain number of fighting men.[29] According to the victor, tablets with lists in Greek characters were found at the Helvetian camp, listing in detail all men able to bear arms with their names and giving a total number for the women, children and elderly who accompanied them.[30] The numbers added up to a total of 263,000 Helvetii, 36,000 Tulingi, 14,000 Latobrigi, 23,000 Rauraci, and 32,000 Boii, all in all 368,000 heads, 92,000 of whom were warriors. A census of those who had returned to their homes listed 110,000 survivors, which meant that only about 30 percent of the emigrants had survived the war. Caesar\'s report has been partly confirmed by excavations near Geneva and Bibracte. However, much of his account has not yet been corrobated by archaeology, whilst his narrative must in wide parts be considered as biased and, in some points, unlikely. For a start, only one[which?] out of the fifteen Celtic oppida in the Helvetii territory so far has yielded evidence for destruction by fire.[citation needed] Many other sites, for example the sanctuary at Mormont, do not exhibit any signs of damage for the period in question, and Celtic life continued seemingly undisturbed for the rest of the 1st century BC up to the beginning of the Roman era, with an accent rather on an increase in prosperity than on a Helvetic twilight.[31] With the honourable status as foederati taken into account, it is hard to believe that the Helvetii ever sustained casualties quite as heavy as those given by the Roman military leader. In general, numbers written down by ancient military authors have to be taken as gross exaggerations.[32] What Caesar claims to have been 368,000 people is estimated by other sources to be rather around 300,000 (Plutarch), or 200,000 (Appian);[33] in the light of a critical analysis, even these numbers seem far too high. Furger-Gunti considers an army of more than 60,000 fighting men extremely unlikely in the view of the tactics described, and assumes the actual numbers to have been around 40,000 warriors out of a total of 160,000 emigrants.[34] Delbrck suggests an even lower number of 100,000 people, out of which only 16,000 were fighters, which would make the Celtic force about half the size of the Roman body of c. 30,000 men.[35] The real numbers will never be determined exactly. Caesars specifications can at least be doubted by looking at the size of the baggage train that an exodus of 368,000 people would have required: Even for the reduced numbers that Furger-Gunti uses for his calculations, the baggage train would have stretched for at least 40km, perhaps even as far as 100km.[36] In spite of the now much more balanced numerical weight we have to assume for the two opposing armies, the battle seems far less glorious a victory than Caesar presented it to be. The main body of the Helvetii withdrew from the battle at nightfall, abandoning, as it seemed, most of their wagons, which they had drawn up into a wagon fort; they retreated northwards in a forced night march and reached the territory of the Lingones four days after the battle. What Caesar implies to have been a desperate flight without stopping could actually have been an ordered retreat of moderate speed, covering less than 40km a day.[37] Caesar himself does not appear as a triumphant victor in turn, being unable to pursue the Helvetii for three days, both on account of the wounds of the soldiers and the burial of the slain. However, it is clear that Caesars warning to the Lingones not to supply his enemies was quite enough to make the Helvetii leaders once again offer peace. On what terms this peace was made is debatable, but as said before, the conclusion of a foedus casts some doubt on the totality of the defeat. As Caesars account is heavily influenced by his political agenda, it is difficult to determine the actual motive of the Helvetii movement of 58 BC. One might see the movement in the light of a Celtic retreat from areas which were later to become Germanic; it can be debated whether they ever had plans to settle in the Saintonge, as Caesar claims (Bell. Gall. 1,10.). It was certainly in the latters personal interest to emphasise any kind of parallel between the traumatic experience of the Cimbrian and Teutonic incursions and the alleged threat that the Helvetii were to the Roman world. The Tigurinis part in the destruction of L. Cassius Longinus and his army was a welcome pretext to engage in an offensive war in Gaul whose proceeds permitted Caesar not only to fulfil his obligations to the numerous creditors he owed money to, but also to further strengthen his position within the late Republic.[38] In this sense, even the character of Divico, who makes his appearance in the Commentarii half a century after his victory over L. Cassius Longinus, seems more like another hackneyed argument stressing Caesars justification to attack, than like an actual historical figure. That the victor of Agen was still alive in 58 BC or, if yes, that he was physically still capable of undertaking such a journey at all, seems more than doubtful. Nevertheless, Divico became somewhat of a hero within the Swiss national feeling of the 19th century and in the course of the "Geistige Landesverteidigung" of the 20th century. The Helvetii and Rauraci most likely lost their status as foederati only six years after the battle of Bibracte, when they supported Vercingetorix in 52 BC with 8,000 and 2,000 men, respectively. Sometime between 50 and 45 BC, the Romans founded the Colonia Iulia Equestris at the site of the Helvetian settlement Noviodunum (modern Nyon), and around 44 BC the Colonia Raurica on Rauracan territory. These colonies were probably established as a means of controlling the two most important military access routes between the Helvetian territory and the rest of Gaul, blocking the passage through the Rhne valley and Sundgau. In the course of Augustus\' reign, Roman dominance became more concrete. Some of the traditional Celtic oppida were now used as legionary garrisons, such as Vindonissa or Basilea (modern Basel); others were relocated, such as the hill-fort on the Bois de Chtel, whose inhabitants founded the new capital of the civitas at nearby Aventicum. First incorporated into the Roman province of Gallia Belgica, later into the Germania Superior and finally into the Diocletian province of Maxima Sequanorum, the former territories of the Helvetii and their inhabitants were as thoroughly romanised as the rest of Gaul. What seems to have been the last action of the Helvetii as a tribal entity happened shortly after the death of emperor Nero in 68 AD. Like the other Gallic tribes, the Helvetii were organised as a civitas; they even retained their traditional grouping into four pagi[39] and enjoyed a certain inner autonomy, including the defence of certain strongholds by their own troops. In the civil war which followed Neros death, the civitas Helvetiorum supported Galba; unaware of his death, they refused to accept the authority of his rival, Vitellius. The Legio XXI Rapax, stationed in Vindonissa and favouring Vitellius, stole the pay of a Helvetian garrison, which prompted the Helvetians to intercept Vitellian messengers and detain a Roman detachment. Aulus Caecina Alienus, a former supporter of Galba who was now at the head of a Vitellian invasion of Italy, launched a massive punitive campaign, crushing the Helvetii under their commander Claudius Severus and routing the remnants of their forces at Mount Vocetius, killing and enslaving thousands. The capital Aventicum surrendered, and Julius Alpinus, head of what was now seen as a Helvetian uprising, was executed. In spite of the extensive damage and devastations the civitas had already sustained, according to Tacitus the Helvetii were only saved from total annihilation owing to the pleas of one Claudius Cossus, a Helvetian envoy to Vitellius, and, as Tacitus puts it, of well-known eloquence.[40] The distribution of La Tne culture burials in Switzerland indicates that the Swiss plateau between Lausanne and Winterthur was relatively densely populated. Settlement centres existed in the Aare valley between Thun and Bern, and between Lake Zurich and the river Reuss. The Valais and the regions around Bellinzona and Lugano also seem to have been well-populated; however, those lay outside the Helvetian borders. Almost all the Celtic oppida were built in the vicinity of the larger rivers of the Swiss midlands. Not all of them existed at the same time. For most of them, we do not have any idea as to what their Celtic names might have been, with one or two possible exceptions. Where a pre-Roman name is preserved, it is added in brackets.[41] Those marked with an asterisk (*) were most likely occupied by neighbouring tribes (Raurici, Veragri, etc.) rather than the Helvetii.

aS'Although the legal system of Singapore is a common law system, the criminal law of Singapore is largely statutory in nature. The general principles of criminal law, as well as the elements and penalties of common criminal offences such as homicide, theft and cheating, are set out in the Penal Code.[1] Other important offences are created by statutes such as the Arms Offences Act,[2] Kidnapping Act,[3] Misuse of Drugs Act[4] and Vandalism Act.[5] In addition, there is a perception that Singapore society is highly regulated through the criminalization of many activities which are considered as fairly harmless in other countries. These include failing to flush toilets after use,[6] littering,[7] jaywalking,[8] the possession of pornography,[9] the sale of chewing gum,[10] and sexual activity; such as oral and anal sex between men.[11] It has been claimed that one of the results of such heavy regulation is that Singapore has one of the lowest incidences of violent crimes in the world.[12] A catchphrase recently used in a police anti-crime campaign was "Low crime does not mean no crime". Singapore retains both corporal punishment (in the form of caning) and capital punishment (by hanging) as punishments for serious offences. For certain offences, the imposition of these penalties is mandatory. More than 400 people were executed in Singapore, mostly for drug trafficking, between 1991 and 2004. Statistically, Singapore has one of the highest execution rates in the world relative to its population, surpassing Saudi Arabia.[13] Science fiction writer William Gibson famously described Singapore as "Disneyland with the death penalty".[14] For most of the 19th century the criminal law which applied in the Straits Settlements (comprising Prince of Wales\' Island (Penang), Singapore and Malacca) was that of the United Kingdom, insofar as local circumstances permitted. There was little doubt that at the time English common law crimes were recognized in these territories. However, due to problems such as doubts as to the applicability of Indian Acts, in 1871 the Straits Settlements Penal Code 1871[15] was enacted. It came into operation on 16 September 1872. The Code was practically a re-enactment of the Indian Penal Code. Over the years, the Penal Code has been amended several times. In 1973 punishments for certain offences were enhanced, and by the Penal Code (Amendment) Act 1984,[citation needed] which came into effect on 31 August 1984, mandatory minimum penalties were introduced for certain offences. A major review of the Code was launched in 2006. Prior to 1870 the law relating to criminal procedure in force in Singapore was found mainly in the Indian Criminal Procedure Act 1852,[16] which was applicable because the Supreme Government of India had power to legislate for the Straits Settlements. After the passing of the Penal Code in 1871, the Indian Act was replaced by the Criminal Procedure Ordinance.[17] However, in general it continued to apply the English system of criminal procedure to the Penal Code. This was subsequently found to be impracticable as the Penal Code had done away with the division of crimes into felonies and misdemeanours. Accordingly, the Criminal Procedure Ordinance 1873[18] was passed to remedy the situation. The Ordinance also did away with the procedure for indictments in favour of charges for all criminal offences; and abolished the grand jury, and special and common juries. A new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted in 1902.[citation needed] The present Criminal Procedure Code[19] was passed by the Legislative Council of the Colony of Singapore on 28 January 1955. All criminal offences under the Penal Code or other statutes are inquired into and tried according to the Criminal Procedure Code. The Penal Code, which is the main statute in Singapore relating to criminal law, has over 500 sections and is divided into the following 24 chapters: The Penal Code defines the elements of each offence and prescribes the maximum, and occasionally also the minimum, penalties for it. The basic form of an offence (commonly referred to as the "simple offence" or, using Latin terminology, as the "offence simpliciter") has the lowest penalties. More serious forms of the offence are defined as separate offences and attract stiffer penalties. For instance, theft is defined in section 378 of the Code, and section 379 makes simple theft (or theft simpliciter) an offence punishable with imprisonment of up to three years or with fine or both. Section 379A punishes the theft of a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor vehicle with imprisonment of not less than one year and not more than seven years and a fine. Sections 380 and 381 respectively make it offences to commit theft in any building, tent or vessel which is used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property; and, while being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, to commit theft of any property in the possession of one\'s master or employer. In both cases the penalty is imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine. The most serious theft offence is that of committing theft, having made preparation for causing death or hurt or restraint, or fear of death or of hurt or of restraint, to any person in order to commit the theft, or in order to effect an escape after committing the theft, or in order to retain property taken by the theft. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for up to ten years and caning with not less than three strokes. An offender is usually charged with the most serious offences that can be established on the facts of the case. On representations being made by the offender\'s lawyer to the prosecuting authority, the Prosecution may agree to charge the offender with lesser offences provided that he or she agrees to plead guilty to the reduced charges. Narcotics laws established by the Misuse of Drugs Act are very strict. Anyone caught with more than 15 grams (0.53oz) of heroin (diamorphine), 30 grams (1.1oz) of cocaine or morphine, 250 grams (8.8oz) of methamphetamine, or 500 grams (18oz) of cannabis faces mandatory capital punishment, as they are deemed to be trafficking in these substances.[20] The stated quantities are the net weight of the substances after they have been isolated by laboratory analysis. Between 1991 and 2004, 400 people were hanged in Singapore, mostly for drug trafficking, one of the highest per-capita execution rates in the world.[13] Persons caught with amounts of controlled substances less than the quantities that would warrant the mandatory death sentence may be spared from the gallows. They may, however, still face harsh penalties ranging from long terms of imprisonment to a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane (for males). '

aS"The Bexell Cottage (Swedish: Bexellska stugan) is a small cottage in Varberg, Sweden. The Bexell Cottage was originally built in 1785 in Harplinge. In 1876, it was bought by politician, member of parliament and land tenure Alfred Bexell, from its owner Jns Jnsson (born 1828) together with all movable. Jnsson was only allowed to retain his day dress, according to the purchase agreement. Even Jnsson's snuffbox passed to the ownership of Bexell. Alfred Bexell was the first in Sweden who bought and protected a Swedish peasant's home for museal purpose. He inspired Arthur Hazelius to establish the open air museum Skansen in Stockholm. In 1906, the cottage was moved to Varberg. In the 20th century, it was called blastugan, a Hallandic name of the type of cottage. In 2003, it became a part of Varberg County Museum. Today it's named Bexell Cottage after Alfred Bexell. In Bexell Cottage there are furnitures and painted wall tapestry from the 19th century. The tapestry cover the walls and ceiling of the cottage. Originally, they were only used for Christmas, but today they are posted all the year around. Bexell Cottage can be visited by the public at the shows of the cottage that are arranged by Varberg County Museum.

aS'HM Prison Wealstun is a Category C men\'s prison, located near the village of Thorp Arch in West Yorkshire, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty\'s Prison Service. Wealstun Prison was formed from the almagamation of HMP Thorp Arch and HMP Rudgate on 1 April 1995; both built in 1965, on the site of ROF Thorp Arch). The amalgamation of two neighbouring establishments was an historic development for the Prison Service, and had the effect of creating a category C closed side and category D open side within one establishment. A great deal of building development has taken place at the prison in recent years, and has recently been completed.. In June 2003, 20 prisoners were involved in a rooftop protest at Wealstun Prison. The inmates smashed windows and climbed up drainpipes and ledges to the roof of the jail. After 19 hours some of the prisoners came down from the roof, but some of the inmates lasted 30 hours on the roof before surrendering peacefully.[1] In February 2004, an inspection report from Her Majesty\'s Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised Wealstun Prison for being mouldy, damp and infested with rats. The report made 135 recommendations for improvements at the jail, and stated that in parts of the prison there was no alarm system, basic repairs had been neglected and windows were smashed or missing.[2] However following a more recent inspection, HMP Wealstun was highly praised for the work undertaken there. In 2008 due to Category C overcrowding problems in the prison service, HMP Wealstun was re-rolled from a Category C/D prison to a wholly Category C prison and as a result the open side of the prison closed, and was converted to provide additional category C accommodation. The new Category C area commenced operation in April 2010. In August 2010, a unnanounced full inspection of the prison by Her Majesty\'s Chief Inspector of Prisons stated that Wealstun "is clearly slipping backwards. The deterioration in safety is the most obvious example but there is a disturbing sense of lack of grip in other areas too. The issues identified in this report need to be addressed quickly and effectively to prevent them from becoming even more serious."[3] The report also made numerous recommendations. Accommodation at Wealstun includes 15 double-occupancy cells on B Wing. The remainder of the Category C cells are single-occupancy covering 10 wings (A - J Wing). Wealstun offers education, workshops, training courses, farms and gardens and a works department. The prison has a Listener Scheme (supported by the Samaritans and prison officers) and a Community Integration Unit and work out scheme. Wealstun is served by Leeds North East Primary Care Trust, with a part-time medical officer and an on-call facility. HMP Wealstun also has extensive services and provisions in place to help with resettlement and reducing reoffending. Wealstun has a Visitors Centre for use on visiting days, and a modern visiting room is in operation, which has play area facilities and a refreshment counter where food may be purchased. HMP Wealstun opened fully as a category C establishment in April 2010 after the security building work was completed on the conversion of the category D part of the prison.

aS'Ron Vanderlinden is an American college football coach. He is currently the linebackers coach at Penn State University. Vanderlinden previously served as the head coach at the University of Maryland from 1997 to 2000. In college, he played football as a four-year starting center at Albion College and twice earned All-MIAA conference honors. He was part of the 1976 Albion Britons football team that achieved a perfect 90 record. Both the 1976 and 1977 teams have since been inducted into the Albion College Hall of Fame.[1][2] In 1978, he started his career as a graduate assistant at Bowling Green and also coached as a graduate assistant at Michigan. His first full-time coaching position was with Ball State in 1982. From 1983 to 1991, he was a defensive assistant at Colorado under head coach Bill McCartney. McCartney had also been an assistant at Michigan with Vanderlinden. During that timeframe, Colorado won the 1990 National Championship. From 1992 to 1996, Vanderlinden served as assistant head coach and defensive coordinator at Northwestern. There he played a part in the reversal of fortunes of a struggling football program into a two-time Big Ten champion.[3] On November 10, 2011 Tom Bradley announced that Vanderlinden and defensive line coach Larry Johnson would serve as co-defensive coordinators. Vanderlinden was retained as linebackers coach under new coach Bill O\'Brien.[4][dead link] In 1997, he was hired as the head coach of the Maryland Terrapins, a team without a bowl game and only one winning season since 1990. In both the 1999 and 2000 seasons, Maryland narrowly missed achieving a winning season and bowl game bid by losing their finale and ended both years with a 5-6 record. Vanderlinden recorded a 15-29 record. Despite these setbacks, Maryland improved significantly during Vanderlinden\'s tenure, winning more games in 1999 than the previous two years combined. His staff also recruited players who would be instrumental in the team\'s meteoric rise in 2001 to an ACC championship, a Bowl Championship Series game, and a top-ten final ranking. Some of these players included linebacker E.J. Henderson, quarterback Shaun Hill, and wide receiver Guilian Gary. Also during Vanderlinden\'s tenure, running back Lamont Jordan set the school record for single-game rushing with 306 yards.[3] Vanderlinden was fired after the 2000 season.[5] As the current linebackers coach for the Nittany Lions, Vanderlinden oversees the school\'s traditional "Linebacker U."

aS"Football in the Philippines is organized by the Philippine Football Federation (PFF) Despite football being popular among its Southeast Asian neighbours, football is usually overshadowed by basketball which is undeniably the most popular sport in the Philippines. Football was virtually unheard of throughout the archipelago as there was no national football league and are also no stadia that would easily pass FIFA requirements. In recent years, football has become an emerging sport in the Philippines. Over a hundred years ago, the Philippines were ceded by Spain to the USA. American sports such as basketball consequently gained the upper hand, at the expense of the once popular game of football. However, since local youngsters, both boys and girls, rediscovered the delights of football, the tide has begun to turn. But there is still a long way to go before football can once again become the country's leading sport. The nation managed to taste some success some time ago by qualifying in the 1991 South East Asian Games) semi-finals. The national association is, however, trying to promote young talent by means of grassroots nationwide programs in an effort to raise football standards to a reasonable level after a spate of poor results. Training programs in all major areas have also been set up, based on FIFA courses such as Futuro. The news that Philippine striker, Alfredo Gonzalez, considered by many as the first ever Filipino professional football player in history and the Philippines' finest striker since the legendary Paulino Alcntara, had signed a contract for a professional Vietnamese club was the first international transfer to hit the headlines in the country for years. The association had hoped that this would serve as an inspiration for other players.[1] However, football ultimately got its revival in the Philippines through the national team's Cinderella run in the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup. The Philippines and FIFA seek to revive the sport to its former glory. Efforts include the launching of a FIFA goal project in 2003 in the city of Barotac Nuevo, Iloilo which involves the construction of a National Training Center.[2] The stunning performance of the national football team of the Philippines during the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup, in which it defeated the defending champion Vietnam and qualified for the semi-finals of the tournament, inspired many Filipinos. This development further boosted the revival of football in the country as Filipinos have begun to show more interest in the sport. Along with renewed public interest, football has been enjoying corporate sponsorship, government support, foreign help and the establishment of a domestic league. Due to the recent renaissance of football in the Philippines,a number of foreign countries and clubs have offered to help promote the sport within the country. In 2010, the German Football Federation (DFB), recommended the services of former Rwanda U-17 coach, Hans Michael Weiss. The DFB also allegedly gave the Philippine Football Federation a 500,000-Euro grant.[3] On October 18, 2011, Real Madrid announced its intentions of opening a youth academy in Mindanao.[4] Another prominent club, Chelsea F.C., also launched a football academy in the Philippines on May 15, 2012. Top officials from Chelsea graced the launch where the grand plan is to put up a blue pitch, the trademark of all the English club's soccer schools.[5] On August 2, 2008, a number of Filipino football enthusiasts and football clubs announced the establishment of the Filipino Premier League as the top-flight football competition in the Philippines. It featured eight clubs which were mainly from the National Capital Region. The first and only champion of the league was Philippine Army Despite all the efforts of it organizers, the Filipino Premier League was discontinued after its inaugural season, mainly because of a lack of public interest and corporate support. Shortly after the dissolution of the Filipino Premier League, the Football Alliance sought to renew the football interest of Filipinos. The Alliance entered discussions with the United Football Clubs Association for the possibility of establishing another top-flight football competition in the Philippines. Instead of creating a whole system and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed to partner with the Football Alliance in operating the United Football League, which was then a semi-professional league. Since the UFL first started, only one club has been crowned league champions. The current defending champions are Philippine Air Force, who won the title in the 201011 season. After league's second season, the AKTV Network became the its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a P150 million (~$3.4 million), 5-year deal which ensures the airing of two live matches every week. Later the deal was further improved, with a new TV arrangement airing four live matches every week on primetime television on Aksyon TV. [6]"

aS'The Israeli Infantry Corps is a corps in the IDF GOC Army Headquarters. It is a maneuvering corps which primarily relies on infantry troops. It includes several regular and reserve service units and brigades which are operatively commanded by the IDFs regional commands. The corps moves to the battlefield either on foot, on jeeps, or on Armoured personnel carriers. Since the corps is based on soldiers who fight on foot, most of the weapons employed are personal or crew-served weapons. The personal weapon of most IDF soldiers is the M16, particularly, the M16A2, shortened CAR-15, M4, and M4A1 assault rifles. The majority of regular-service Infantry Corps soldiers are equipped with the shortened M16, but the longer model is still in use among recruits and reserve forces. In 2005, the IMI Tavor Commando assault rifle was brought to operational use, and is intended to become the corps\' principal assault rifle in the future. Every soldier in operational service is also equipped with various hand grenades. The company and platoon weapons are diverse, and include the IMI Negev and the Fabrique Nationale MAG machine guns. Heavier weapons include the Browning M2 and the General Dynamics Mk 19 grenade launcher. Various units also use snipers who rely on the M16A2E3, the Remington M24 Sniper Weapon System, the Barrett M82A1, and recently the H-S Precision Pro Series 2000 HTR. To engage armored targets, the corps uses a variety of grenades, rockets, and missiles. The corps units are equipped with Anti-tank RPGs such as the RPG-7, the M72 LAW, and B-300 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon. Recently, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems MATADOR anti-structures rocket was entered to service, used successfully in Operation Cast Lead. These are relatively cheap and easy to operate weapons, and are in high availability to target vehicles or buildings. Since modern campaign tanks are heavily armoured, the designated weapon against them are Anti-tank guided missiles, which are more expensive and difficult to operate than RPGs. The corps primarily uses Tow and the Spike missiles. The corps uses a variety of vehicles for transport, scouting, troop mobility, security, and command and control. The light scout and mobile vehicles are Sufa jeeps and Humvees. The former are reasonably defended but not heavily armoured as they are expected to provide utmost speed and navigability. The Humvee, on the other hand, exists in a variety of forms, some relatively heavily defended, some entirely "open." It is equipped with either a machine gun, rocket, anti tank missiles, communications equipment, sometimes including a small trailer. For transporting troops through hostile areas, the "Safari" is a converted bus equipped with heavy armor. Under heavy fire, troops are primarily transported by APCs. Often, because of the armor offered by the APC, much of the fighting takes place with these, which are equipped with machine guns, mortars, rockets, or anti tank missiles. The IDF\'s principal APC is the M113, primarily those purchased from the United States during the 1970s. Despite upgrades and improvements, it is considered an old and vulnerable APC. To respond to the need for heavier APCs, the IDF adapted a variety of older or captured tanks to serve as heavy APCs, such as the Achzarit on a T-55 chassis and the Nagmachon and Nakpadon on Centurion tank chassis. Some heavy APCs were originally combat engineering vehicles, such as the Puma, used by the Combat Engineering Corps to transport heavy engineering materials, but due to its heavy armor, sometimes used to transport troops into hostile areas. Recently, the Namer APC, a heavy APC/IFV based on a Merkava tank, was entered into service.'

Pea is also noted for having starred in I Married Dora, a sitcom that lasted only 13 episodes in 1987, as Dora Calderon, the "Dora" of the show\'s title. In the final show, the cast broke the "fourth wall" by announcing their cancellation on-camera and taking a curtain call. Writer-director John Sayles produced the critically acclaimed but short-lived television series Shannon\'s Deal (19891991) co-starring Pea alongside series lead Jamey Sheridan. In 1996, Sayles wrote and directed the mystery film Lone Star and again cast her in a co-starring role. Pea\'s first marriage, to William Kibler, ended in divorce in the early 1990s. She then married a carpenter, Hans Rolla, in 1994. They have two children: one daughter, Fiona, and one son, Kaelan.'

aS'OuluKontiomki railway is a railway line in Finland. The line is owned and maintained by the Finnish Rail Administration. It connects the city of Oulu to station at Kontiomki, which is a junction of five railway lines in Paltamo municipality, approximately 26 kilometres (16mi) north from the city of Kajaani. The line is single-tracked and electrified with a total length of 166.1 kilometres (103.2mi). The traffic is controlled via centralized traffic control by the operator located in Oulu rail traffic control center at Oulu railway station. The line follows the south shore of Oulu River. The electrification was taken in commercial service on December 1, 2006, the power was turned on on October 1, 2006. First commercial electric-powered trains ran on November 1, 2006. The maximum allowed speed is 120 kilometres per hour (75mph) in passenger service, and 100 kilometres per hour (62mph) in freight service. Passenger service speeds will be raised to 140 kilometres per hour (87mph) once the necessary precautions regarding level crossing safety have been completed and approved. Centralized traffic control was completed in 1998. Traffic consists of a mixture of passenger and freight trains. Most of the traffic is freight traffic originating at Kontiomki, Uimaharju (on JoensuuKontiomki line) and Vartius. The only operator is the national rail operator VR. There are eight daily passenger trains (four in each direction). The line is most noted for the presence of heavy taconite unit trains. These trains originate in Kostomuksha, Russia, and terminate in Kokkola, Finland, where the ore is transloaded in to bulk ships. Previously taconite train also ran to Rautaruukki steel mill in Raahe, but this traffic ceased early in 2007, when Rautaruukki decided to order the taconite from LKAB in Sweden. The line was built in five sections over the course of four years. First segment to be taken in service was a line from Vuokatti to Paltamo via Kontiomki in 1926. After this eastern segment was built, a line east from Oulu to Muhos was taken in service in 1927, followed by Muhos to Utajrvi in 1928, and Utajrvi to Vaala in 1929. The last segment, joining Vaala with Paltamo was completed in 1930. On May 23, 1995, an avoiding line was taken in service at Kontiomki. This enabled the traffic between Vartius and Oulu to bypass the Kontiomki station, without the need to perform run-around moves at Kontiomki yard. OuluKontiomki line connects with SeinjokiOulu main line (Pohjanmaan rata) and OuluTornio main line at Oulu. At Kontiomki the line connects with two main lines: IisalmiKontiomki and JoensuuKontiomki, as well as with freight-only branch lines KontiomkiVartius and Kontiomkimmnsaari.

aS'Koshigoe (?) is a part of the municipality of Kamakura, Kanagawa prefecture, Japan, located at the western end of the beach of Shichirigahama, near Fujisawa.[1] The name seems to stem from the fact it was founded by people who crossed ("goe") the base ("koshi") of the mountains to reach the fertile plains near the sea.[1] This small town\'s name has gone down to history for its deep links with beloved hero Minamoto no Yoshitsune who, having defeated the Taira clan in 1185, arrived in Koshigoe with Taira no Munemori as his prisoner in tow.[2] He meant to bring him personally to Kamakura, but was forbidden to enter by his brother Yoritomo.[2] His prisoner was however taken away and paraded on Wakamiya ji, Kamakura\'s main street.[3] Yoshitsune waited fruitlessly for the permission to enter for about 20 days at Koshigoe\'s Manpuku-ji, near Shichirigahama, then dictated to his attendant Benkei a letter for Yoritomo destined to become famous, the "Letter from Koshigoe". He later gave up and left, but his brother pursued him and his severed head, pickled in sake, was exposed to the public\'s view, again in Koshigoe, four years later.[2] In 1335, Hj Tokiyuki was defeated here by Ashikaga Takauji and his army.[2] Coordinates: 351830.6N 1392935E / 35.308500N 139.49306E / 35.308500; 139.49306 '

aS'John Paul Vann (July 2, 1924  June 9, 1972) was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, later retired, who became well known for his role in the Vietnam War. Vann was born as John Paul Tripp in Norfolk, Virginia, out of wedlock, to John Spry and Myrtle Lee Tripp. Vann\'s mother married Aaron Frank Vann, and Vann took his stepfather\'s surname; Vann had three half-siblings, from Aaron and Myrtle: Dorothy Lee, Aaron Frank, Jr., and Eugene Wallace. In 1942, Aaron Vann officially adopted him. The Vann children grew up in near-poverty but through the patronage of a wealthy member of his church, Vann was able to attend boarding school at Ferrum College. He graduated from its high school in 1941, and from its junior college program in 1943.[1] With the onset of World War II, Vann sought to become a pilot. In 1943, at the age of 18, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Vann underwent pilot training, transferred to navigation school, and graduated as a second lieutenant in 1945. The war ended before he could see action, however. He married Mary Jane Allen of Rochester, New York in October 1945. He was 21 years old. [2] They would have five children. When the Air Corps separated from the Army in 1947 to form its own branch of service, the United States Air Force, Vann chose to remain in the Army and transferred to the infantry. He was assigned to Korea, and then Japan, as a logistics officer. When the Korean War began in June 1950, Vann coordinated the transportation of his 25th Infantry Division to Korea. Vann joined his unit, which was placed on the critical Pusan Perimeter until the amphibious Inchon landing relieved the beleaguered forces. In late 1950, in the wake of China\'s entrance into the war and the retreat of allied forces, now-Captain Vann was given his first command, a Ranger company, the Eighth Army Ranger Company. He led the unit on reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines for three months, before a serious illness in one of his children resulted in his transfer back to the US. He completed his undergraduate degree at Rutgers University, specializing in economics, mathematics, and statistics.[3] In 1954 Vann joined the 16th Infantry Regiment in Schweinfurt, Germany, becoming the head of the regiment\'s Heavy Mortar Company. In 1955 he was promoted to major and transferred to Headquarters US Army Europe at Heidelberg where he returned to logistics work. In 1957 Vann returned to the US to attend the Command and General Staff College, a requirement for promotion to lieutenant colonel, and in 1961 Vann was promoted. He earned his Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree from Syracuse University, and worked toward his doctorate in Public Administration.[4] Vann was assigned to South Vietnam in 1962 as an advisor to Colonel Hunh Vn Cao, commander of the ARVN IV Corps. In the thick of the anti-guerrilla war against the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, Vann became concerned with the way in which the war was being prosecuted, in particular the disastrous Battle of Ap Bac. Directing the battle from a spotter plane overhead, he earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for his bravery in taking enemy fire. He attempted to draw public attention to the problems through press contacts such as New York Times reporter David Halberstam, focusing much of his ire on MACV General Paul D. Harkins. Vann was forced from his advisor position in March 1963 and left the Army within a few months.[citation needed] Vann accepted a job in Denver, Colorado with defense contractor Martin Marietta and succeeded there in a term of nearly two years, but missed Vietnam and angled to return.[5] Vann returned to Vietnam in March 1965 as an official of the Agency for International Development (AID).[citation needed] After an assignment as province senior adviser, Vann was made Deputy for CORDS (Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support) in the Third Corps Tactical Zone of Vietnam, which consisted of the twelve provinces north and west of Saigon the part of South Vietnam most important to the US. CORDS was an integrated group that consisted of USAID, U.S. Information Service, Central Intelligence Agency, and State Department along with U.S. Army personnel to provide needed manpower. Among other undertakings, CORDS was responsible for the Phoenix program, which involved "neutralization" of the Viet Cong infrastructure.[citation needed] Vann served as Deputy for Civil Operations and Rural Development Support CORDS III (i.e., commander of all civilian and military advisers in the Third Corps Tactical Zone) until November 1968 when he was assigned to the same position in IV Corps, which consisted of the provinces south of Saigon in the Mekong Delta.[citation needed] Vann was highly respected by a large segment of officers and civilians who were involved in the broader political aspects of the war because he favored small unit, aggressive patrolling over grandiose, large unit engagements. Unlike many US soldiers, he was respectful toward the ARVN soldiers notwithstanding their low morale, and was committed to training and strengthening their morale and commitment. He encouraged his personnel to engage themselves in Vietnamese society as much as possible and he constantly briefed that the Vietnam war must be envisaged as a long war at a lower level of engagement rather than a short war at a big-unit, high level of engagement.[citation needed] On one of his trips back to the U.S. in December 1967, Vann was asked by Walt Rostow, an advocate of more troops and Johnson administration National Security Advisor, whether the U.S. would be over the worst of the war in six months: "Oh hell no, Mr. Rostow," replied Vann, "I\'m a born optimist. I think we can hold out longer than that." Vann\'s wit and iconoclasm did not endear him to many military and civilian careerists but he was a hero to many young civilian and military officers who understood the limits of conventional warfare in the irregular environment of Vietnam.[citation needed] After his assignment to IV Corps, Vann was assigned as the senior American advisor in II Corps Military Region in the early 1970s when American involvement in the war was winding down and troops were being withdrawn. For that reason, his new job put him in charge of all United States personnel in his region, where he advised the ARVN (Army of the Republic of Vietnam) Commander to the region and became the first American civilian to command U.S. regular troops in combat. His position was the equivalent of the job of a major general. After the Battle of Kontum, he was killed when his helicopter crashed. He was 47 years old. He was buried on June 16, 1972 in Section 11 of Arlington National Cemetery. His funeral was attended by such notables as Gen. William Westmoreland, Maj. Gen. Edward Lansdale, Lt. Col. Lucien Conein, Senator Edward Kennedy, and Daniel Ellsberg. On June 18, President Richard Nixon posthumously awarded Vann the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\'s highest civilian citation, for his ten years of service as a top American in South Vietnam. For his actions from April 2324, 1972, Vann, ineligible for the Medal of Honor as a civilian, was also awarded (posthumously) the Distinguished Service Cross, the only civilian so honored in Vietnam.[citation needed] Neil Sheehan wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning Vietnam history and biography of Vann, A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam, in which Sheehan examines Vann\'s alleged career-stunting incident involving a morals charge during his service in West Germany and how this possibly affected Vann\'s future actions and resulting career path in Vietnam. In 1998, HBO made the picture A Bright Shining Lie a film adapted from the book, with Bill Paxton playing the role of Vann. Richard Neely, Capt.

aS'The Healesville railway line, in Melbourne, Australia, was the non-electrified continuation of the suburban Lilydale line, extending into the Yarra Valley. The line closed in the 1980s, but a heritage railway group is working to retain part of the line. The Lilydale railway line was extended to Yarra Flats (now known as Yarra Glen) on 15 May 1888 with intermediate stations at Coldstream and Yering. Part of the structure included a long timber viaduct with 502 openings near Yarra Glen, spanning the Yarra River and the adjacent flood plains.[1] The extension of the line from Yarra Glen to Healesville on 1 March 1889 required a 1 in 40 climb into a 154.4 metre tunnel with a corresponding descent at nearly the same grade. Opened at the same time was the intermediate station of Tarrawarra. Traffic on the line included timber, livestock, milk and dairy products. Early timetables included regular goods services specifically for transporting milk. The last regular steam passenger service was hauled in August 1964. From this time until closure of the line in 1980, passenger services were run using diesel-electric rail motors. As from 9 December 1980 all services were withdrawn, except for some goods services to Coldstream. The line was officially closed to all traffic on 10 March 1983.[2] Around 2003 the uncontrolled level crossings at Beresford Rd and the Macintyre Lane were effectively removed by simply rebuilding the roads at a slightly raised level, burying the tracks beneath the bitumen. This was advantageous for the bus company whose depot is situated near the Beresford Rd crossing as buses are required to come to a complete stop at uncontrolled level crossings even if the rail line is disused. Stopping is no longer necessary now that the crossing has been removed. On 7 February 2009 most of the trestle bridges which were a major part of the viaduct crossing the Yarra river and its floodplains were destroyed in the Black Saturday bushfires. The Healesville line had both passenger and freight services. The passenger services generally ran as a shuttle between Lilydale and Healesville stations. The freight services transported local timber, live-stock, and dairy products. Early trains running on the line included a daily evening "mixed milk and passenger train" and a single milk train on Sundays. Prior to electrification reaching Lilydale in November 1925, the line was operated by \'A2\' locomotives. After this time passenger trains on the Healesville and Warburton lines were run by two electric motor carriages from Melbourne to Lilydale, at which place \'K\' or \'D3\' steam locos took the carriages onto Healesville and Warburton. On 28 October 1957 the steam hauled 7-day-a-week service was replaced by a 153hp Walker railmotor operating four services a day each way and three on weekends. Prior to this, services were limited to three each way on weekdays and two each way on weekends. On 21 April 1958 the Victorian Education Department subsidised school trains using a Walker railcar. This rail car service crossed with other services at Yarra Glen until 1972. Throughout the existence of the line many steam and diesel locomotives and railcars operated on the Healesville line. By 1913 all classes of locomotives were permitted on the line, however by 1918 all classes but the C class were allowed. Towards the closure of the line the DERM (Diesel Electric Rail Motor) was only permitted a maximum speed on 30km/h and no locomotive-hauled passenger trains were permitted. Only "Y" class diesels could haul the freight services due to the deterioration of the track condition, which resulted in the derailment of T401 on 5 August 1980. The Yarra Valley Railway currently run a Walker railcar from Healesville to the Tarrawarra Winery, crossing the Watts River, under the Donovan\'s Road overbridge and through the tunnel. There are plans in place to improve the line from Healesville to Tarrawarra to a standard suitable for the running of Rail Motors, with further goals being reconstruction to Yarra Glen and Lilydale. In addition, works are underway to restore the track from Yarra Glen to Simpsons Lane with a view to bringing trolley services to Yarra Glen. Railmotor operations have commenced with restored 153hp walker railmotor RM22 receiving accreditation to run a passenger train on the line as of 5 March 2010. It ran its first paying passenger run since restored on 7 March with the seats being auctioned in singles, doubles and triples to the exhibitors of the model railway show. The tourist railway is in possession of a number of locomotives, including two Victorian Railways J-class steam engines, a T-class diesel-electric locomotive, a W-class diesel-hydraulic locomotive, a 153hp Walker Rail motor and a diesel electric rail motor (DERM). Services to Healesville mostly departed from Lilydale.'

aS'Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism is an influential non-fiction book by art historian David Summers, who aims to reconcile Western art history to artistic cultural production around the world from all time periods. In the book, Summers creates his own art history methodology to explore spatial attributes of art and architecture and their connection to social functions throughout time. He disregards traditional formal and iconographical art historical models, aiming to explore cultural traditions from around the world within the chapters.[1] Summers divides the world into "Real Space", the space we share with other people and objects, and "Virtual Space", the space that exists within two dimensions which people "seem to see." He explains, Real space is the space we find ourselves sharing with other people and things; virtual space is space represented on a surface, space we seem to see. In fact, space can only be represented visually as virtual, but at the same time we always encounter a virtual space in a real space. [2] Facture is understood as an indication that an object has been made. Summers considers concepts of form, such as seriality, diachronicity, etc. Some are given new definitions, others are adjusted in relation to the existing literature; others do not change meaning at all. Summers relates and interconnects the concepts together in relationship to artworks such as Benvenuto Cellinis Salt Cellar of Francis I, of 1539-43 to other artworks like Late Neolithic Arrowheads. The conceptual themes, such as fracture, become critical tools throughout the book. [1] Places is based on that places, as real social spaces, provide the possibility for the actual statement of relations of difference" [3] The chapter discusses the concepts of difference (emphasizing its spatial qualities), centers and diasporas, shrines precincts, boundaries, paths, alignments and orientations, and the idea of a periphery and division of land outside the sanctum. For example, a Navajo hogan. [4] The Appropriation of the Centre gathers Egyptian, Akkadian, Roman, Khmer, Chinese, and French examples to articulate the change from cultures in which rulers appropriate the center. Rulers use centre as, the point where the world is defined, with its values of collective generation, and the combination of notional cosmic order and vital centrality provides the political order [5] For example, Shi Huangdis capital of Xianyang. [1] Images opens with a realignment of discussions on the origins of images, proposing that "images are fashioned in order to make present in social spaces what for some reason is not present" [6] They are therefore substitutive, and it is important to study their "conditions of presentation" and "the relations of those conditions to our own spatiotemporality." [7] Planarity follows the development of planar orders "as they shape and enable all kinds of routine, second-natural practices and activities" [8] Concepts that follow from planarity include order (which is one of the basic relations between parts of an image, but is also "analogous to the order of the parts of something to which the image refers," [9] measure and proportion, hierarchy, framing and division, symmetries, oppositions, profiles and frontal figures, harmony, ratio, grids, and maps. [1] Virtuality concerns the capacity to complete images by seeing three dimensions in two or by perceiving what is absent from what is given. Virtuality raises the problem of illusion, and effigies, narratives, and doubting or skepticism. [1] Conditions of Modernity examines the conditions of presentation, trying to characterize the formation of Western modernity as a tradition of place and image-making traditions. [10] Summers examines Lszl Moholy-Nagys, Untitled (Looking Down from the Wireless Tower, Berlin) of 1932. Summers proposes that Western art history and world art history can be united by Post-Formalism, a new type of formalist artistic interpretation that privileges the form or shape of the art object. Throughout the text, Summers uses various definitions he has created or re-interpreted to better understand art objects based primarily on their form, which he believes will provide different cultural or social meanings of art.

aS"SMK Tun Abdul Razak is a national middle/higher secondary school on the outskirts of Kuching, the capital of the East Malaysian State of Sarawak. It is located at KM 38, Jalan Kuching/Serian. It was created in 1959 under the Colombo Plan by the Australian government and was named Dragon Secondary School. The name is derived from the hills that surround the school, like the coils of a dragon's body. The name is often falsely attributed to the winding road that leads to the school. Dragon School was administered by Australian personnel under the Colombo Plan until 1967 before it was taken over by the Malaysian Education Ministry. For at least a decade after that, the Form Six classes of the school were often taught by Volunteer Service Overseas personnel from England, Australia and New Zealand. On July 12, 1980, Dragon School lost its unique identity when its name was changed to that of Kolej Tun Abdul Razak, making it indistinguishable from any other secondary school in the country. On January 1, 1999, its fate was sealed when it was renamed Sekolah Menangah Kebangsaan Tun Abdul Razak. It has now fallen into the obscurity of the Malaysian Education system, its unique history, forgotten by almost all but those who were lucky enough to have been educated under its roof when it was still Dragon School.

At an elevation of 1,460 metres (4,790ft), Rocca Calascio is the highest fortress in the Apennines. Built of stone and masonry exclusively for military purposes and intended only to accommodate troops and never as residence for nobles, the fortress overlooks the Plain of Navelli at one of the highest points in the ancient Barony of Carapelle. Construction of the fortress started in the tenth century as a single watchtower. A walled courtyard with four cylindrical towers at the corners around a taller inner tower was added in the thirteenth century. The lower half of the fortress is built with distinctively larger stones than its upper half. It is believed that this feature was to make its base impenetrable to invaders. The fortress was never tested in battle. However, it was badly damaged in November 1461 by an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 7 to 8 on the Richter Scale.[1] While the town of Calascio, which lies below the fortress, was rebuilt, the fortress was not.[2] Rocca Calascio lies within the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park and alongside the high plain of Campo Imperatore. Near the fortress, at a slightly lower elevation, is Santa Maria della Piet, an octagonal church built in the seventeenth century.

aS'Herbert Osborne Yardley (April 13, 1889  August 7, 1958) was an American cryptologist best known for his book The American Black Chamber (1931). The title of the book refers to the Cipher Bureau, the cryptographic organization of which Yardley was the founder and head. Under Yardley, the cryptanalysts of The American Black Chamber broke Japanese diplomatic codes and were able to furnish American negotiators with significant information during the Washington Naval Conference of 1921-1922. He later helped the Nationalists in China (19381940) to break Japanese codes. Following his work in China, Yardley worked briefly for the Canadian government, helping it set up a cryptological section (Examination Unit) of the National Research Council of Canada from June to December 1941. Yardley was let go due to pressure from Washington.[citation needed] Yardley was born in 1889 in Worthington, Indiana. He learned to use the telegraph from his father, Robert Kirkbride Yardley, a station master and telegrapher for a railroad. His mother, Mary Emma Osborn Yardley, died when he was 13. After graduating high school in 1907, Yardley went to the University of Chicago, but dropped out after one year and went back to Worthington, where he worked as a telegrapher for a railroad.[1] He spent his free time learning how to play poker and applied his winnings towards his further schooling. In 1912, after passing the civil service exam, he was hired as a government telegrapher. Yardley began his career as a code clerk in the U.S. State Department. He accepted a Signal Corps Reserve commission and served as a cryptologic officer with the American Expeditionary Forces in France during World War I. His career in cryptology began with his work in the code room, as he broke the U.S. government codes that crossed his desk. At that time, American codes were very weak and Yardley solved them easily. He was shocked to learn that President Wilson was using a code that had been in use for over ten years. The weakness of American codes worried Yardley, especially considering the war in Europe, so in May 1916 he began writing a hundred-page Solution of American Diplomatic Codes, which he gave to his boss. Breaking American codes got Yardley wondering about the codes of other countries. American participation in the war gave Yardley an opportunity to convince Major Ralph Van Deman of the need to set up a section to break other countries\' codes. In June 1917, Yardley became a 2nd lieutenant in the Signal Corps and head of the newly created eighth section of military intelligence, MI-8.[2] One early case was the cryptogram discovered in the clothing of German spy Lothar Witzke after he was arrested at the Mexican border in 1918. The evidence linked Witzke to significant sabotage activity in the U.S. Yardley proved to be a very good administrator and during the war the people of MI-8 performed well even if they did not have any spectacular successes. After the war, the American Army and the State department decided to jointly fund MI-8 and Yardley continued as head of the "Cipher Bureau". They located their operations in New York City for legal reasons. Cracking Japanese codes was a priority. David Kahn states:[3] After almost a year, Yardley and his staff finally managed to break the Japanese codes and were still reading Japanese diplomatic traffic when Washington hosted the Washington Naval Conference in 1921. The information the Cipher Bureau provided the American delegation regarding the Japanese government\'s absolute minimum acceptable battleship requirements was instrumental in getting the Japanese side to agree to a 5:3 ratio instead of the 10:7 ratio the Japanese Navy really wanted. This allowed Japan only 18 battleships to 30 for the U.S. and 30 for Great Britain instead of the 21 battleships Japan desired. This was the height of Yardley\'s cryptanalytic career. Unfortunately, Yardley spent much of his time in New York involved in unrelated activities. Also, the flow of diplomatic telegrams dried up as companies became less willing to break the law to help the government. In Washington, William Friedman was actively exploring cryptographic frontiers for the Army. The Cipher Bureau was becoming irrelevant. However, it was moral indignation that finally doomed the bureau. When Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of State under President Herbert Hoover, found out about Yardley and the Cipher Bureau, he was furious and withdrew funding, summing up his argument with "Gentlemen do not read each other\'s mail".[4] Some believe that Stimson was most offended when Yardley bragged that he could read all traffic of the Vatican, for it was after this remark Stimson turned and left the room. MI-8 closed its doors for good on October 31, 1929, just two days after the stock market crashed. With Yardley\'s esoteric skills in very low demand, he took up writing about his experiences in codebreaking to support his family. His memoirs, The American Black Chamber, were published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1931. The book outlined the history of the first U.S. Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) organization, described the activities of MI-8 during World War I and the American Black Chamber in the 1920s, and illustrated the basic principles of signals security. This work was instantly popular. Its critics at the time concluded that it was "the most sensational contribution to the secret history of the war, as well as the immediate post-war period, which has yet been written by an American. Its deliberate indiscretions exceed any to be found in the recent memoirs of European secret agents."[5] In the U.S., 17,931 copies were sold, with 5,480 more sold in the U.K. It was translated into French, Swedish, Japanese, and Chinese. The Japanese version sold an unprecedented 33,119 copies. This book was an embarrassment to the U.S. government and compromised some of the sources Yardley and his associates used. Through this work an estimated 19 nations were alerted that their codes were broken. Much of the post-World War I codebreaking was done by obtaining copies of enciphered telegrams sent over Western Union by foreign diplomats, as was the custom before countries had technology for specialized communications devices. William F. Friedman, considered the father of modern American signals intelligence (SIGINT) gathering, was incensed by the book and the publicity it generated in part because sources and methods were compromised and because Yardley\'s contribution was overstated. While Yardley may have thought that publishing this book would force the government to re-establish a SIGINT program, it had the opposite effect. The U.S. Government considered prosecuting him, but he had not technically violated existing law regarding protection of government records. In 1933, the Espionage Act was amended, PL 37 (USC Title 18, section 952), to prohibit the disclosure of foreign code or anything sent in code.[6] Yardley\'s second book, Japanese Diplomatic Codes: 1921-1922, was seized by U.S. marshals and never published. The manuscript was declassified in 1979. The American Black Chamber represents an early example of the expos national security books that would appear after World War II, such as The Codebreakers and The Puzzle Palace, which also focus on U.S. SIGINT operations and organizations. In 1935, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released Rendezvous, a fictional film "based on a book by Herbert O. Yardley." The film, starring William Powell and Rosalind Russell, and directed by William K. Howard, concerns a German spy ring stealing U.S. government codes during World War I, as well as U.S. Army efforts to crack German codes. Yardley did cryptologic work for Canada (although pressure from the U.S. on the Canadian government meant this was limited) and China during World War II, but he was never again given a position of trust in the U.S. government. Despite this, in 1999 he was given a place in the National Security Agency Hall of Honor. None of Yardley\'s many later attempts at writing were as successful as The American Black Chamber, though he published several articles and three spy/mystery novels (The Blonde Countess, Red Sun of Nippon, and Crows Are Black Everywhere). He contributed as a writer and technical advisor to several movies, including Rendezvous, based very loosely on one of his novels, The Blonde Countess. His 1957 book on poker, Education of a Poker Player, which combined poker stories with the math behind the poker strategies, sold well. Another book of cryptographic memoirs, The Chinese Black Chamber, about his work in China, was declassified and published in 1983. Yardley died on August 7, 1958, nearly a week after having a major stroke. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery, Grave 429-1 of Section 30. Yardley is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame. The National Cryptologic Museum\'s library has 16 boxes of Yardley\'s personal files.'

Taylor was born at Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, but was educated at Oakham School in Rutland and Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. He later undertook studies at the University of Cambridge and Carnegie College, Leeds.[1] A right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace, he made his first-class cricket debut for Leicestershire against Lancashire in 1937 County Championship. He made two further first-class appearances for the county in that season, against Glamorgan and Warwickshire.[2] He scored 49 runs at an average of 12.25, with a high score of 22 in his three matches.[3] While playing for Leicestershire he also took what would be his only first-class wicket, that of Emrys Davies.[4] Taylor served during World War II, entering service with the Northamptonshire Regiment as a 2nd Lieutenant in October 1940.[5] He later moved to Scotland in 1948, where he transferred from the Northamptonshire Regiment to the Royal Scots and was at the same time promoted to Lieutenant.[6] On 1 June 1950 he was still serving in the Royal Scots and at this time was promoted to Captain.[7] In October 1950 he was awarded the Territorial Decoration for his service in the Territorial Army.[8] He was removed from the Active List in February 1951, but was allowed to retain his then rank of Captain. Following the war he taught at Loretto School, having started teaching there in 1951, where he helped run the schools Combined Cadet Force. He first appeared for the Scotland in first-class cricket in 1952 against Yorkshire. He made five further first-class appearances for Scotland, the last of which came against the touring Pakistanis in 1954.[2] In his six first-class matches for Scotland, he scored 149 runs at an average of 24.83, with a high score of 78.[3] Later in 1957, Taylor finally resigned his commission from the Territorial Army, but was again allowed to retain the rank of Captain.[9] He was still teaching at the school in 1966, the year in which he was promoted to Lieutenant, the highest substantive rank in the Combined Cadet Force.[10] He resigned his commission in the Combined Cadet Force in January 1971, upon which he was granted the honorary rank of Major.[11] He later briefly stood as an umpire in first-class cricket, once in 1978 when Scotland played Ireland and again in 1979 when Scotland played the touring Sri Lankans.[12] He died at Edinburgh, Midlothian on 16 May 1993.'

aS'State decorations of the Czech Republic recognize outstanding acts of service to the Czech Republic. They are awarded by the President of the Czech Republic, usually, but not necessarily, on the recommendation of the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate or the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. They may also be promulgated solely on the president\'s authority.[1] They come in two varieties: orders being the higher honor and medals the lower. As originally envisioned by the constitution in 1992, the president had little more than a ceremonial role with respect to state decorations. According to Article 63, he promulgated an order or an award on the recommendation of the government, as expressed by the signature of the Prime Minister. The constitution did not clearly give the president a way to refuse such a referral, unless it came to him by way of an enacted law, vulnerable to his veto. However, nothing in the constitution suggests that a recommendation for decoration be voted on by parliament.[2] However, Article 63 also allows for the president to be granted powers by a lesser law to "exercise powers not explicitly defined in the Constitutional Act". Such a law came into effect in 1994, which allowed for the president to award state decorations on his own authority. It also seemed to multiply the legislative routes by which a person could be recommended for an award. As a consequence of this 1994 change, the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Government, or the President can all recommend a person to receive a decorations. In any of these cases, however, it is still the responsibility of the president, or his designee, to actually present the award. This 1994 act  The Act on the State Decorations of the CR  specifically codifies what are the orders and medals capable of being conferred or awarded. Annexes (or amendments) to the Act instructed that the designs for the insignia associated with the state decorations should be chosen following a public competition. By law, insignia for all state decorations are individually numbered, and accompanied by a matching numbered certificate.'

aS'The hope of a condemned Man is a series of three paintings by Joan Mir in 1974 which are now part of the permanent collection of the Joan Mir Foundation in Barcelona. [1] During the last years of Francoist Spain there were some controversial legal decisions that shocked the painter. Mir painted this triptych in reference to the hope of grace as he prayed for the life of the young anarchist Salvador Puig Antich.[2][3] This series directly recalls another 1968 painting titled Painting on white background for the cell of a recluse.[4] The works are the result of a two year process during which Mir made several preparatory drawings with various ideas to approach the challenge. These drawings are preserved at the Mir Foundation. [5] In February 1974 he painted these ideas, but he didn\'t finish the artwork until a month later, coinciding with the execution of another anarchist. - It was what? - His death. The line is interrupted. A leaflet, which I call The hope of a condemned Man. I hope that these three paintings remain in Barcelona, at the Foundation. - The relationship between these paintings and the drama of Puig Antich was not sought at the beginning? Successive representations show a patch that changes color according to the transformation of a flowing black line with splashes of paint. The line tries to describe a form that can not be completed as it is unexpectedly interrupted. This parallels the tragic cut our of the life of the young garroted activist. This work was created in 1974. The line comes fast, secure, multiple, from underground, reality, to take off on the horizon, the future. Mir knows that each line presents an enigma, his work as an artist has always been the same: on paper, on canvas, in cardboard, wood sculpture... filling the space of signs that give meaning to the work and his medium. Mir in his maturity flight away from the formulas of vocabulary to achieve expression. The paintings are characterized by heavy graphics, drawn with a single breath, without rejecting Mir traditional forms, but simplifying the gesture. Imposed increasingly growing the importance of the empty space. Mir reaches maximum difficulty arises when suggesting a poetic image, creating tension, expressing a certain mood with minimal resources. This is the reason why he use every time larger formats, despite the static, they seem to create dynamism. [6] Mir painted these large scale works (as well as Bleu II) influenced under the impression that he got on his stay in the United States. The action painting by Jackson Pollock and the abstract expressionism by Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko clearly influenced Mir, although that the forms of Mir are not abstract figures, but remain true to the nature, source of inspiration [7] In the art world there was a big disappointment as a result of the catastrophe of the World War and the atrocities that occurred, which left a society that had placed science and its progress to the development of the atomic bomb and had ended up being ruled again by the conservative classes. The art was going to be worth enjoyment become consumer value. In response to this position wealthy, many artists are inclined to experiment with forms of expression. One of the great figures of expressionism was Motherwell (1915-1991), who painted one of his most famous works with a long series Elegy to the Spanish Republic (1955-1960). The choice of the theme suggests painting a "subjective" reality of the (much more indirect than the Guernica on Picasso). [8] Great artists appeared at the United States, like Pollock, Franz Kline or de Kooning with an energetic and gestural painting, and Rothko who didn\'t used figurative painting. The painting becomes a meditation on the screen to the viewer. Mir\'s fascination for Japanese art and master SengaiGibon influenced many European and American abstract artists of the moment. The simplicity of the work of Sengai intriguing, combining geometric shapes with vertical texts caused a strong impact on Miro, who began a vocabulary of signs themselves, which Mir visual color experience the great power that supposed to make the spectator in front of three formats, a combination not only works separately, but to offer a completely new visual field that fills the viewer (TATE) There is a strong relationship between scarce resources and the dramatic impact TAT) At the time Mir painted The hope of a condemned Man, we find a Europe post-May 68, Protestant and unhappy, and also find that Spain looks like the dying dictatorship of General Franco. At the same time there is a Joan Mir fully recognized and also is filled with skills to find creative new ways. Mir had visited the Japan, where there had been several exhibitions. Orientalism always represented by a spring of Mir received influences. Mir has been defined as an international Catalan, which had an internal exile because of Franco, a political artist, surrealist avant-garde and modernist.[9] Mir himself says that the artist is a person with a special civic responsibility, your voice must speak for the silent, and his work for the emancipation, understood that his work had the obligation to promote, to claim, talk, to serve man [10]'

aS'Out of My Intention (Hangul:  ; RR: Nado Moleugae) is a 2008 South Korean short film written and directed by Yoo Ji-tae. It is the third short film by actor-turned-director Yoo, and the first of his films to receive a public release. Lee Dae-yeon and Jo An star as the films only characters. An unnamed middle-aged man (Lee Dae-yeon) drives listlessly through downtown Seoul on a downcast summer afternoon, with the view outside, periodically glimpsed through the car windows, fuzzy and blurred. Sitting in the passenger seat next to him is Ok-gyeong (Jo An), a young woman some twenty years younger than he is. Although their dialogue is scarcely distinguishable with regard to its content, the two are engaged in a typical lover\'s quarrel. The woman is desperate to talk through their problems, but the man remains silent. Their drive along the highway is interrupted by memories of the past, which include dates taken by the lovers in the countryside, and surreal fantasy scenes where Ok-gyeong has her face painted like a mime artist.[2][3] Out of My Intention is the third directorial project by Yoo Ji-tae, following his earlier short films Bike Boy and How Does the Blind Dream.[3] Regarding the brevity and ambiguity afforded by the short film format, Yoo said, "If I had made the film into a full feature, I would have had to give all of the sundry reasons and episodes about their initial relationships".[2] Actor Lee Dae-yeon admitted to being "a bit baffled" by the film\'s script, but felt compelled to take the part after Yoo told him it had been written with him in mind.[3] Like Yoo\'s earlier shorts, the central theme in Out of My Intention is one of love.[3] The film is a blend of past and present; though the two characters talk to each other constantly, the camera almost never captures them together in one frame.[2] The man is actually "driving down memory lane" and reminiscing about his first love, his thoughts conjuring her back to life. While he has grown old and weary, Ok-gyeong remains young in his heart, suggesting that first love never dies.[3] The press preview for Out of My Intention received an unusual level of interest, much to the surprise of director Yoo Ji-tae. The first of his films to be released theatrically, it opened on 20 March 2008 at the Gwanghwamun Spongehouse in Seoul, where it was given a limited screening.[2][3] At the South Korean box office, Out of My Intention peaked at 42 over its opening weekend,[4] and as of 6 April 2008, it had grossed a total of $2,027.[1] In June 2008, Out of My Intention was screened at the Short Shorts Film Festival in Tokyo, where director Yoo won the Special Mention Award.[5] It later competed at the Mise en scne Short Film Festival, held from June to July 2008,[6] the New York Korean Film Festival in August 2008,[7] the Vancouver International Film Festival from September to October 2008,[8] and the Asiana International Short Film Festival in November 2008.[9] Lee Hyo-won of The Korea Times described Out of My Intention as an "audiovisual poem", albeit a "rough draft", and noted the director\'s "ability to orchestrate subtle emotions" in spite of the film\'s short running time, going on to say, "Yoo takes full advantage of the film medium, creating an ambiance from what is included and excluded in the mise-en-scene." The review also praised the contribution of the cast, saying, "Lee gives the film a nice gravitational pull, weighing down the fluffy parts, while fresh actress Jo An... embodies youthful vigor and beauty.[3]'

aS'A New Day Has Come is the ninth English-language album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released by Sony Music Entertainment on March 22, 2002. It was her first new studio album since 1997\'s Let\'s Talk About Love. Dion returned to the music scene after a two-year hiatus when she gave birth to her first child. She collaborated on A New Day Has Come with various producers, including Anders Bagge and Peer strm for the first time. Dion\'s long-time producer and friend, David Foster, did not appear on this album. A New Day Has Come garnered mostly positive reviews from the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a "broader, more adventurous" range of pop music and "dips its toe" into modern music, particularly dance ("Sorry for Love"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like "I Surrender" and "Have You Ever Been in Love," or the title track. Critics also praised "Ten Days," "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," "I\'m Alive," "When the Wrong One Loves You Right," "The Greatest Reward," and two covers: "Nature Boy" and "At Last." A New Day Has Come became a commercial success throughout the world and entered number one in more than seventeen countries. It has sold 3.3 million units in the United States and was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping over 600,000 copies, the album was certified six-times Platinum. The IFPI certified it three-times Platinum for selling over three million units in Europe. Overall, A New Day Has Come has sold twelve million copies worldwide. The first single, "A New Day Has Come" was released in March 2002 and peaked inside the top ten in Canada and Europe. In the United States, it reached number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and broke the record for most weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, staying on top for twenty-one weeks. The next single, "I\'m Alive" was issued in August 2002 and also peaked inside the top ten in numerous European countries. The last commercial single, "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)" was released in November 2002 and performed moderately on the charts, reaching the top forty in Europe. After the farewell millennium concert on December 31, 1999 in Montreal, Dion decided to take a break from the public scene for two years to focus on her family. On January 25, 2001, she gave birth to Ren-Charles Angelil, her first son. Since then, she had performed publicly only a handful of times, including September 21, 2001, when she sang a live rendition of "God Bless America" at the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon honoring victims of the September 11 attacks, and September 28 for Montreal\'s companion fund-raiser, A Show for Life, singing "L\'amour existe encore."[1] According to Dion, the album\'s title, A New Day Has Come, acknowledged a new chapter in her life and career. However, she was also deeply affected by the events of September 11 and wanted the words to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. "It represents my child, because I gave life," Dion said. "Obviously, it also marks my return with a new album. But a new day has also come in the lives of other people because something bad has happened, because we\'ve lost lives, because there\'s a scar on our world now."[1] Dion struggled over an appropriate image for the cover of the album, feeling that a portrait reflecting her good fortune was in poor taste. She suggested to Sony Music Entertainment that the album cover not include her picture. However, after much discussion, the photo shoot for A New Day Has Come took place in Montreal in late December 2001 with well-renowned photographer Melvin Sokolsky.[2] On January 30 and 31, 2002 an additional photo session for the album took place in Florida, on a beach near Dion\'s home by the French photographer Patrick Demarchelier.[3] The album cover for A New Day Has Come by Demarchelier was released on February 28, 2002.[4] Ren Anglil, Dion, and the Sony family began selecting prospective songs at the beginning of 2001, and on August 28, 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal\'s Piccolo Studios. Because of Dion\'s unwillingness to leave her seven-month old baby, the album\'s collaborators traveled to Montreal.[1] "I didn\'t feel the pressure to try and outdo anything," Dion said of her time in the studio. "I proved myself before, so now I can enjoy. I was relaxed, I just let go. It was such a pleasure."[1] The album was scheduled for release internationally on March 25, 2002 and in North America on March 26, 2002.[5] However, it was first released in Australia, on March 22, 2002.[6] Most of the producers of the album has worked with Dion before: Walter Afanasieff, Kristian Lundin, Andreas Carlsson, Christopher Neil, Guy Roche, Robert John "Mutt" Lange, Ric Wake, Aldo Nova, Simon Franglen and Humberto Gatica. The new ones included Swedish musicians Anders Bagge, Peer strm and Arnthor Birgisson, French singer Grald de Palmas and the US producer Steve Morales. A New Day Has Come showcases Dion\'s traditional themes of love and hope. She sings ballads alongside several uptempo pop tracks and a pair of standards.[1] The album contains sixteen tracks on the North American version and seventeen on the international editions, including "Super Love."[7] It features "A New Day Has Come," the title track, which for Dion represents the birth of her child but "it can mean different things for anyone who has to find strength again;" I\'m Alive", "fun" and "fresh" song from the team that wrote "That\'s the Way It Is;" "I Surrender," the album\'s "bombastic, heart-pounding" ballad which has become a popular song choice for contestants on reality television singing competitions like American Idol;[8] "Sorry for Love," a dance number written and produced by the Swedish team, co-written by Kara DioGuardi; "Have You Ever Been in Love," a power ballad also written and produced by Bagge and strm; "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," an emotional ballad about the death of one\'s mother which Dion first heard three years prior but turned it down at that time; "Nature Boy," a 1947 song made popular by Nat King Cole that features Dion accompanied only by piano as originally foreseen symphonic orchestration was not added; "At Last," a gospel-tinged number first recorded by Glenn Miller in 1941; "Ten Days," a rock-oriented adaptation of "Tomber" (2000) by Grald de Palmas which was recorded at the last minute after Dion heard the original French version; "The Greatest Reward," an adaptation of "L\'envie d\'aimer" (2000) from the French musical Les Dix Commandements, performed originally by Daniel Lvi; and "Aun Existe Amor," a Spanish-language version of Dion\'s French song "L\'amour existe encore."[1][9] On November 11, 2002 in Europe and November 19, 2002 in North America, Sony Music Entertainment released a Limited Edition of A New Day Has Come, which includes the original album, as well as a bonus DVD featuring the "I\'m Alive" video, a preview of Dion\'s Las Vegas show A New Day... as well as two previously unreleased tracks, "Coulda Woulda Shoulda" and "All Because of You."[10] The North American Limited Edition includes longer version of "The Greatest Reward" lasting 4:04, instead of original 3:28. On January 29, 2008, Legacy Recordings released a Collector\'s Edition of A New Day Has Come with bonus DVD. The CD contains sixteen tracks from the North American version of the album, including extended version of "The Greatest Reward," and the DVD features four music videos, and behind the scenes footage from making of the album and the "A New Day Has Come" video.[11][12] Dion actively promoted the album, including various television show appearances and concerts.[9] Her A New Day Has Come television special was taped on March 3, 2002 at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles and aired on CBS on April 7, 2002.[13][14] During the show Dion performed "A New Day Has Come," "I\'m Alive," "At Last," "Have You Ever Been in Love," "Nature Boy" and a movie medley with the songs "Because You Loved Me", ""Beauty and the Beast"" in duet with Brian McKnight and "My Heart Will Go On." She also sang "Aun Existe Amor" and "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," but both songs were not broadcasted. Destiny\'s Child joined her to perform together the "Emotion/When the Wrong One Loves You Right" medley. On March 17, 2002 Dion taped La spciale Cline Dion in Paris, France to promote the album in Francophone countries. This television special was broadcasted on March 30, 2002 on TF1.

It was broadcasted on ABC on November 14, 2002.[19] She sang "That\'s the Way It Is," "My Heart Will Go On," "The Prayer" in duet with Josh Groban and "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)." For the finale, Dion joined other artists to perform with them "Aren\'t They All Our Children."

Dion also performed "Woman in Love" in duet with Natasha St-Pier and joined Lm to sing Stayin\' Alive." The special was broadcasted on November 22, 2002 on M6.[20] The first single, "A New Day Has Come" premiered on the radio on February 6, 2002.[21] The music video was shot in mid-February 2002 in West Palm Beach, Florida and directed by Dave Meyers.[22] It premiered on March 13, 2002 and the CD single was released outside the United States at the same time.[23] "A New Day Has Come" became a top ten hit in Canada and Europe, including number seven in the United Kingdom.[24] In the United States, it was released as an airplay-only track, which led to its peak position on the Billboard Hot 100 at number twenty-two.[25] However, on the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, the song broke the record for most weeks at number one, staying on top for twenty-one weeks.[26] Also directed by Meyers, the music video for next single, "I\'m Alive" was filmed in late May 2002 in Los Angeles and the song was serviced to radio stations on June 7, 2002.[27] At the same time, two remixes of "I\'m Alive" premiered: Humberto Gatica Mix and The Wake Up Mix. The music video debuted on June 27, 2002.[28] "I\'m Alive" was also featured in the soundtrack for the movie Stuart Little 2 and the CD single was released in early August 2002 in Europe, Australia and Canada.[29][30] The song peaked inside the top ten in various European countries which led to its number two position on the European Hot 100 Singles.[31] In the United States, it reached number six on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks.[32] The third and last commercial single, "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)" was released to radio on October 10, 2002.[33] The music video was filmed in the Chteau d\'Aunoy castle in France in mid-October 2002 and directed by Chris Applebaum.[34] It premiered on November 21, 2002 and the CD single was released at the same time in Europe, reaching the top forty in various countries.[35][36] On the U.S. Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)" peaked at number twenty-seven.[37] Sony Music Entertainment released also two promotional singles in the United States: "Aun Existe Amor" and "At Last."[38][39] The first one was issued after Dion performed the song at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in May 2002 where she was honoured with a special award for "My Heart Will Go On," which was the first English-language song to top Billboard\'s Hot Latin Tracks chart.[40] "At Last" was sent to the adult contemporary radio stations in December 2002 and peaked at number sixteen on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks.[41] Although not changed, "Have You Ever Been in Love" was also included on Dion\'s next album, One Heart and released as a single in April 2003.[42] The song spent fourteen weeks at number two on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States.[43] The album garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Chuck Taylor from Billboard gave it a favorable review, saying that Dion explores a "broader, more adventurous" range of pop music. Among the highlights, he mentioned "Sorry for Love" where Dion "dishes out her first all-out dance anthem" and holds a twelve second "authentic note that puts the "d" in diva," "I\'m Alive" and "When the Wrong One Loves You Right," which he described as "hitworthy uptempo gems," the rock-leaning "Ten Days," and a Spanish track, "Aun Existe Amor." According to Taylor, Dion doesn\'t disappoint with ballads like the "rafter-shaking" "I Surrender" where she sings of "forbidden love amid a firestorm of utterly volcanic instrumentation" and "The Greatest Reward," and two standards  the "diamond-dipped" "Nature Boy" and gospel "At Last." He called the album the most "versatile and gratifying" Dion\'s recording yet.[1][46] Larry Flick, also from Billboard wrote about another song, "Have You Ever Been in Love" that "at a time when music is frightfully aggressive and the world at large is fraught with turmoil, a classic Dion power ballad is a warm source of comfort." The track "builds from a gentle, piano-laced opening into a deliciously theatrical, string-framed climax." All along, Dion offers an "appealing palette of vocal colors that range from delicate and breathy to full-bodied and appropriately dramatic."[50] Chuck Taylor also reviewed all three singles from the album. He wrote that the life-affirming "A New Day Has Come" "comes off like a gentle exhale against the world\'s ills." The Ric Wake Radio Remix of "A New Day Has Come" opens with an "Enya-inspired whisper before a shuffle skips in and lifts the song upward like a dove gracefully taking flight." The Album Edit "comes sans the beat, allowing Dion\'s performance alone to fully color the message." According to him, on both versions Dion "embraces a particularly restrained performance  dramatic enough to steer the track\'s emotion, but still delicate to offer comfort."[51] "I\'m Alive" demonstrates a stylistic "left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion." The "percolating" Humberto Gatica Mix "adds juice" to the Album Version, while the uptempo Wake Up Mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion\'s most "inspired and festive" remix to date, with Blondie\'s "Heart of Glass" woven into the beat to "splendid effect."[52] Taylor criticized the choice of the third single, "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," a ballad relegated solely to adult contemporary radio stations. He noticed that the song is "devastatingly beautiful," offering a loving tribute to one\'s mother at death\'s door and that Dion "delivers it with a heaving helping of passion, emotionally drawing one\'s attention to the devotional message." Although he felt that many will connect to the loss of a parent, on a commercial level, this was a disappointing decision. According to Taylor, songs like "Sorry for Love" and "When the Wrong One Loves You Right" were primed for radio airplay and dancefloor remixes and were ideal candidates for release.[53] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars saying that its construction is "as perfect as it could be." It doesn\'t "deviate" from Dion\'s mainstream audience, yet it "dips its toe" into modern music, particularly dance, while "keeping hip" ("Nature Boy"). Although Erlewine described "Rain, Tax (It\'s Inevitable)" as "bizarre," he wrote that "there\'s really nothing to fault it on, actually," the album is "more ambitious than it needs to be, covers more stylistic territory than any other Dion record, while never abandoning the middle-of-the-road; it\'s a balancing act that nobody since Barbra Streisand has been able to pull off." According to Erlewine, the songs aren\'t "that particularly memorable," "the mood shifts effortlessly, it never seems to stay in one place," but it "never catches hold, either."[44] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave A New Day Has Come three out of five stars. According to him, Dion is great at what she does and "if she ever tried anything too edgy she\'d probably just sound foolish." Cinquemani disliked "Rain, Tax (It\'s Inevitable)" but praised "Sorry for Love" on which Dion "gets the Cher treatment," an unexpected "change of pace that actually works." Among other highlights he mentioned two covers, a "soulful" rendition of "At Last" and a "simple and moving" arrangement of "Nature Boy." He also noticed that the album is "packed" with the usual adult contemporary songs: "I Surrender," a power ballad "only a singer with Dion\'s voice could pull off," "Ten Days," the guitar-driven "catchy pop-rocker with a surprisingly edgy vocal," "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," a track featuring Shania Twain on backing vocals that "will leave you nauseous or in tears," "I\'m Alive," the "uplifting" midtempo number and "A New Day Has Come, the "stirring" title track.[49] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the album B. He felt that A New Day Has Come was "over-arranged" by producers, which works "against Dion\'s enthusiasm for the wonders of babies and innocence." Nevertheless, he praised the "jaunty disco" of "Sorry for Love," and "Have You Ever Been in Love" which "builds in intensity to sound like "a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand." Tucker described "Rain, Tax (It\'s Inevitable)" as the most "idiosyncratic" and "idiomatic" song that Dion has ever recorded.[47] According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, A New Day Has Come "picks up where Falling into You left off." Dion\'s album is a full of "bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she\'s ever done." Attempts at modernity are "spotty," though "welcome." Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," with "two soaring key changes" in the same song, which is then launched into a "high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy."[48] Barnes & Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more "spiritual" and "edgier" Dion. They praised the "uplifting" title track, "heartfelt, country-tinged" "Goodbye\'s (The Saddest Word)," "anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad" "Prayer," "bluesy, honky-tonk rocker" "Ten Days," "soaring ballad" "Have You Ever Been in Love," and "solid renditions" of "Nature Boy" and "At Last."[45] Dion earned two career achievements with the debut of A New Day Has Come in the United States. It became her first album to open at number-one on the Billboard 200  her fourth number-one overall  and it set a personal best for first-week sales (558,000 units). Previously, 1997\'s Let\'s Talk About Love sold 334,000 in its first week, while 1999\'s All the Way... A Decade of Song opened with 303,000.

aS'Super League was an Australian rugby league football administrative body that conducted professional competition in Australasia for one season in 1997. Along with Super League of Europe, it was created by News Corporation during the Super League war which arose following an unsuccessful attempt to purchase the pay television rights to rugby league in Australia. After two years of legal battles the competition was played for a single season in 1997 alongside the rival Australian Rugby League (ARL) competition before the two merged in 1998 to form the National Rugby League (NRL).  The domestic competition was competed by ten clubs: eight that had previously competed in the Australian Rugby League, and two new teams. The teams were the Adelaide Rams, the Auckland Warriors (now the New Zealand Warriors), the Brisbane Broncos, the Canberra Raiders, the Canterbury Bulldogs (now the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs), the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, the Hunter Mariners, the North Queensland Cowboys, the Western Reds, and the Penrith Panthers. The Telstra Cup was a ten team competition held over 18 rounds. The season was dominated by the minor premiers, the Brisbane Broncos, who won 14 of their 18 matches, losing only to the Penrith Panthers, the Hunter Mariners and eventual runners-up, the Cronulla Sharks. The Grand Final was played at Brisbane\'s ANZ Stadium in front of 58,912 people, the ground record for that venue. The Broncos defeated the Sharks 268 to win their third premiership. The Auckland Warriors had teams in both the Reserve grade and two age-group Grand Finals but lost all three. The winners in all grades were: The Super League Tri-series was contested by New South Wales, New Zealand and Queensland. Each team played the others once, with the best two teams playing a final. New South Wales defeated Queensland 2322 in the final at ANZ Stadium In 1997 the Super League Australia selected team played two games against New Zealand, winning the inaugural ANZAC Test and losing the return match. At the end of the season Australia also played a three-Test series against Great Britain in the British Gas Test series.[1] Australia won the series by two games to one. Although these matches are considered to be Tests by the New Zealand Rugby League and the English Rugby Football League, they are not recognised by the Australian Rugby League. As News had signed up most rugby league organisations outside of Australia, the ARL was starved of international competition. They had intended playing a team of New Zealand players signed with ARL clubs but the New Zealand Rugby League took out an injunction in the Federal Court preventing the ARL from using the terms "Test", "Representative Team", "New Zealand" or "All Golds".[1] The ARL instead played Tests against rebel teams from Papua New Guinea and Fiji, as well as defeating a Rest of the World team in July 1997. The Oceania Cup was run by Super League in place of the Pacific Cup. It was contested by the Cook Islands, Fiji, Tonga, New Zealand Mori, New Zealand XIII and Papua New Guinea. New Zealand XIII defeated New Zealand Maori 2015 in the final. The World Club Challenge, which had been contested occasionally since 1975, was expanded in 1997 to include all ten Australian Super League clubs competing against all twelve European clubs. The European teams were outclassed, winning only 8 of 83 matches, and suffering many heavy defeats. The competition was unpopular in Australia, and it lost $6,000,000 due to small crowds and heavy travel expenses. The Brisbane Broncos won the final defeating the Hunter Mariners 3612 at Ericsson Stadium, Auckland. The Super League Challenge Cup competition was played between the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. The Australian Capital Territory won the competition, defeating the Northern Territory 4014 at ANZ Stadium Brisbane on 19 May 1997. In 1996 and 1997 the Super League World Nines competition was held. In 1997 the tournament was known as the Gatorade Super League World Nines due to sponsorship. Nines rugby league is a faster form of the game with only nine players on the field at a time playing in shorter halves. The World Nines competition were held as an alternative to the ARL\'s World Sevens. The 1996 World Nines were held in Suva, Fiji from 22 to 24 February. The winner of this competition was New Zealand. The 1996 World Nines marked the first time that a video referee was used for a game of rugby league. The 1997 World Nines were held in Townsville, Queensland from 31 January to 2 February. New Zealand won this competition for the second year in a row. As the Rugby Football League had signed with News Corporation, a twelve team club competition was held from 1996 in Europe. Although Super League damaged the public perceptions and financial standing of rugby league in Australia,[2] a number of concepts that it introduced lived on into the new millennium. An addition to the regular tests played between Australia and New Zealand, the ANZAC Test was introduced by Super League. There was some controversy at the time for the use of the word ANZAC, as many considered it inappropriate to compare sportspeople to soldiers. Although it was dropped from the annual schedule in the early years of the new millennium, it was revived in 2004, and is now contested each year. The Super League Telstra Cup Grand Final was played on a Saturday night in Brisbane, whereas all NSWRL and ARL grand finals were traditionally played on a Saturday afternoon (until 1980), or Sunday afternoon (from 1981). From 2001 the NRL has played its grand finals on the Sunday night in October (although in the afternoon/early evening since 2008 because of television scheduling), to coincide with a public holiday in New South Wales the following day. Although a ratings success for the Nine Network, this scheduling continues to upset traditionalists, who believe that having the Grand Final on a Sunday afternoon allows people to better celebrate the day, particularly with a Grand Final barbecue. Some in Sydney also believe that holding the grand final at night dissuades parents with young children attending. It is also very unpopular outside of New South Wales, as there is no public holiday in Queensland the following day, and the grand final begins late in the evening in New Zealand. At the Super League World Nines in 1996 the video referee was used for the first time.[3] The Video referee allows an official to check the veracity of tries scored using footage from the television broadcasters. The NRL used Video Referees from its first season in 1998. A number of rule changes were introduced in both the Super League and the ARL during the war that have been adopted by the NRL. Super League innovations include: An ARL rule change for the 1997 season that was adopted by the NRL and is still in force is the popular 40/20 rule. Under this rule, attacking teams kicking the ball into touch \'on the bounce\' from inside the 40 metres closest to their goal line, with the ball crossing the sideline inside the opposing team\'s 20 metre area, receives a scrum feed. Previously the defending team received the scrum feed.

aS'"Home Sweet Home" is a power ballad by the American heavy metal band Mtley Cre. It was originally released in 1985 on the album Theatre of Pain, and again in 1991 for the Decade of Decadence compilation album. It has been recorded as a cover version by several artists, and was released as a single by Carrie Underwood in 2009. The 1991 version had a new music video, different from the original version. Along with "Wild Side", "Home Sweet Home" is one of the rare Mtley Cre hits to have Vince Neil credited with the songwriting, though he did play a part in writing many of their non-hit songs. Originally released on the band\'s 1985 album, Theatre of Pain, the song was accompanied by a music video which documented the band\'s undertakings over the course of a concert, or several concerts. Some of the original video was shot in Houston, Texas live at The Summit Arena during the 1985 Theatre of Pain tour. They performed the song twice that night apparently to get more video footage. The Summit Arena has had several names over the years, The Compaq Center and finally converted into Lakewood Church. "Home Sweet Home" was released & remixed twice: once for the original promotion for the single in 1985. A radio only promo 12" with the remix was sent to stations, but not released commercially until the 1988 Japan-only EP Raw Tracks. The song was remixed again in 1991 and had some instruments overdubed. Now called "Home Sweet Home \'91", it was released as a single with a new video and included on the Decade of Decadence compilation. The song is often referred to as a power ballad, and its success was a prelude to similar marketing formula for other hair bands in the late 1980s.[1] The song ranks number twelve on VH1\'s chart of the greatest power ballads of all time. Drummer Tommy Lee re-recorded the song for Season 4 of the TV series Californication, and has a cameo in "Lights, Camera, Asshole" performing the song on piano in a bar at the end of the episode. Also, the third episode in the show\'s fourth season was named after this song. The original release of "Home Sweet Home" charted at number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100, and "Home Sweet Home \'91" peaked at number 37 on the same chart in 1992.[2] To date, "Home Sweet Home \'91" is the last Mtley Cre song to chart in the American Billboard Top 40. The video (directed by Wayne Isham) depicts each band member receiving a phone call home, and replying "I\'m on my way!", Vince Neil on a beach, Mick Mars on a throne in a haunted house, Nikki Sixx at a bar, and Tommy Lee at a wild party. The piano intro begins as a tour bus driving by is shown. The rest of the video shows the band pre-concert and performing on stage. The video is notable for its long stay on top of the MTV daily request chart, lasting over three months until MTV invoked the unwritten "Crue Rule", dropping videos from eligibility on their request line after thirty days. The end of the video shows the same tour bus from the beginning with the words "Rockin \'N\' Rollin". Carrie Underwood recorded a cover version in 2009 for the American Idol season 8 send-off song. On the chart week of March 28, 2009, "Home Sweet Home" made a debut at number 21 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart based on sales of the digital single. It debuted on the Hot Country Songs chart at number 52. It also debuted at number 33 on the Canadian Hot 100. Carrie Underwood performed the song live on May 19, 2009, following the final performances of American Idol\'s eighth season. Her version appears on American Idol when they play flashbacks of the person on The Big screen. It also appeared on the Deluxe Edition of her third studio album Play On. United States: 288,000[6]'

aS'Skulls Unlimited International, Inc. is a commercial supplier of osteological specimens located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Skulls Unlimited provides a skull cleaning service, using dermestid beetles to strip the flesh from skulls and skeletons.[2] Skulls Unlimited processes approximately 25,000 skull specimens per year.[3] In the summer of 1986, Jay Villemarette found himself out of work after being laid off from his auto body job and started considering the possibility of working full-time with skulls. In June of that year he established Skulls Unlimited International.[1] His fascination with skulls and bones began when he was seven years old, after he found a dog skull in the woods near his home. That interest, along with encouragement from his father,[4][5] led Villemarette to begin collecting other animal skulls. After graduating from high school, he collected and sold skulls in his spare time[6] while working as an auto body technician. As sales grew, Villemarette and his wife Kim began to clean skulls in their kitchen.[5] After relocating to a retail location for his business in 1992, Villemarette was able to employ his first full time employees Skulls Unlimited remained at their South Shields address until June 2000, when they expanded into a custom built facility in Oklahoma City. In 23 January 2013, Villemarette guest starred on John Hodgman\'s podcast Judge John Hodgman as an "expert witness" to comment on the hobby of collecting skeletons and taxidermied animals.[7] In 2004, Skulls Unlimited started construction on a new 12,000-square-foot (1,100m2) building that now houses Skulls Unlimited\'s corporate offices and The Museum of Osteology. The museum opened to the public on October 1, 2010 and features thousands of skull and skeletal specimens,[8] focusing on the form and function of the skeletal system.'

aS'Jack Edward Garner (September 19, 1926  September 13, 2011) was an American film and television actor, known for The Rockford Files and numerous other television roles. He was the brother of James Garner.[1][2][3][4] Garner was born Jack Edward Bumgarner in Norman, Oklahoma, on September 19, 1926, to Mildred Scott Meek and Weldon Warren Bill Bumgarner.[1][3][5] He was the second of three brothers including actor James Garner (youngest) and Charles Bumgarner (oldest).[3][5] The family operated a general store on Denver Corner in eastern Norman.[3] The brothers were sent to live with relatives after their mother died, while Garner\'s father remarried several times.[1] Garner was a star athlete at Norman High School, playing on the state championship basketball team in 1945.[3] Jack Garner played as a minor league baseball pitcher for a team affiliate with the Pittsburgh Pirates for eleven years.[1][5] He then worked for several golf courses in Florida after leaving the minor leagues.[5] Years later, brother James Garner wrote about Garner\'s athletic abilities in his memoir, "At Norman High, he was a point guard on a championship basketball team and quarterbacked an all-state football team...But his best sport was baseball: Jack was a pitcher in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for 11 years. He was a better athlete than I was and a lot more outgoing. I was always in his footsteps."[3] Later in life, Garner became a golf pro at the Oakmont Country Club in Glendale, California.[2][5] His golf experience allowed him to coach at the country club and elsewhere.[4] Garner taught Dan Aykroyd, his co-star in the 1996 film, My Fellow Americans, to properly swing a golf club for a scene in that movie.[4] Jack and James eventually moved to Los Angeles to reconnect with their father, who had relocated to southern California.[1][2][4] Both changed their names to Garner after the move west.[3] The third brother, Charles Bumgarner, who died in 1984 at the age of 60, remained in Norman and became a school administrator.[3] Garner entertained as the lead singer for the Coconut Grove nightclub, located in the now defunct Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles early in his career.[5] Jack Garner began acting in television during the late 1960s.[1] His roles included guest appearances on Love, American Style, The Bionic Woman, The Doris Day Show, Daniel Boone, The Green Hornet, Medical Center and Murder, She Wrote.[1][4] He appeared in The Rockford Files in more than sixty television episodes of the show.[1] Garner later appeared in Bret Maverick portraying Jack the Bartender from 1981 to 1982.[1] Garner reprised his Rockford Files roles in a series of television movies based on the series from 1996 to 1999.[2] Garner\'s film roles included Wild Rovers in 1971, Maverick in 1994, My Fellow Americans in 1996 and Sunset in 1988.[1] Jack Garner suffered a fall in September 2011, which resulted in a broken hip.[3][4] Doctors determined that his heart was not strong enough to withstand surgery to repair the hip so Garner was transferred to a facility for long-term care.[3] However, his condition suddenly worsened within one week.[3] Garner died at a hospice in Rancho Mirage, California, near his home in Palm Desert, on September 13, 2011, six days shy of his 85th birthday.[2] He was survived by his former wife, Betty Bumgarner; his daughter, Liz Bumgarner, and son-in-law, Don Dykstra; and brother, James Garner.[1][2] His memorial service was held at the Wiefels Mortuary in Palm Springs, California.[4]'

aS'Daisyhead & The Mooncrickets was a project of Dax Riggs between 1995 and 1997 that never took off. Only two Daisyhead recordings are known to exist. Daisyhead & the Mooncrickets is akin to an urban legend for fans of underground bluesy rock. But the two works, especially "Skeletal Circus Derails," are an important chapter in Riggs\' history. Fans to this day regularly ask him to play certain songs from that album when they see him on tour. (The possibility of that happening has not been ruled out.) They also detail a point in Riggs\' career when he\'s struggling for life after Acid Bath, which disbanded following the death of bassist Audie Pitre in 1997. Toward the end of Daisyhead & The Mooncrickets, Riggs was pushing for a more melodic sound, which materializes in his subsequent bands Agents of Oblivion and Deadboy & the Elephantmen. But, that sound was first heard on the Daisyhead recordings. The first known recording is Skeletal Circus Derails which is a 6 song recording and is the namesake of the Riggs fan site SkeletalCircus.com. The second recording is a self-titled 14-track recording from 1997, where most of the songs are cut off before they end. A few covers are included, David Bowie\'s "Ziggy Stardust" being among them. Half (or more) of the song titles are unknown. It\'s also perhaps the earliest recording of the "Deadboy & the Elephantmen Theme Song," which Riggs would sometimes play when he formed a band by that name in late 2000.'

aS"Powerball is an event played in several incarnations of the television series Gladiators. In this event, two contenders simultaneously face three Gladiators on a field with the contenders trying to score by putting balls into scoring baskets while the Gladiators try to prevent this. The Powerball field has five scoring pods, four near the outer corners and one in the centre. At both ends are baskets containing sponge balls of two different colours. On the whistle, the contenders must select their appropriately colored ball and must attempt to place it in one of the five scoring pods by dodging or outrunning the Gladiators. The Gladiators must attempt to stop the contenders from scoring by either tackling or pushing the contenders outside of the field. The event lasts 60 seconds and contenders receive two points for a score in one of the outer baskets and three points for getting a centre basket. Both contenders had 4560 seconds to place as many balls in one of the five baskets to score points. However, in order for this to happen, they must pass through three Gladiators and try not to get tackled by them, as they try to stop them from scoring. Should a ball touch the floor, it is deemed as 'dead' and will not count as a score should it be put in a pod. Contenders may not pick up a ball from the same side in consecutive attempts and are not allowed to pick up dead balls. Should a contender be pushed out of bounds, then the ball they are holding will be deemed dead. Contenders may not make any aggressive move towards the Gladiators, but are allowed to attempt to throw the ball into the basket. The Gladiators are not allowed to intentionally target just one contender and must spread their team so that both contenders are marked. Gladiators may not perform dangerous high tackles or tackles round a contender's neck, nor may they deliberately knock over the scoring pods. Powerball has seen more injuries than any other event in Gladiators. Different amounts of points are awarded in some territories for scoring, and some territories have had different time limits. In Sweden, this event went under the name 'Attackbollen', translated as The Attack Ball. In Finland it was called Taistelupallo, translated as Battle Ball. In Australia and America, there is a 'contender safety zone' that spans from the box, containing replacement balls and the edge of the actual Powerball field. Gladiators may not tackle contenders in this area. Powerball first aired during the initial season of American Gladiators, in which the event lasted 45 seconds. The scoring pods were small which meant that contenders would generally be unable to score by throwing the balls at the baskets. Initially, the event was played on a semi circle field with the ball baskets in the center and scoring pods round the edge of the semi circle. 15 points were awarded for each score. From the second half of series 1, the field was changed into what would become its traditional format of a rectangular course with 5 scoring pods. A contender safety zone was incorporated into the space between the balls baskets and the edges of the Powerball field. Scoring results were changed with contenders receiving between 1 and 3 points for scoring in an outer basket and between 2 and 5 points for a score in the central basket dependent on the season and round. Overtly aggressive tackles by Gladiators would result with them being sent off, unreplaced as opposed to receiving a warning from the referee. During the second half of season 1, all tackles were prohibited, and from the quarterfinals of that season until the beginning of Season 2, Gladiators were disqualified if they tackled a contender. This resulted in much higher scoring and one match during the quarterfinals where one Gladiator was forced to defend against both contenders after the other two had been disqualified for tackling. In subsequent seasons, only the first Gladiator to be called for a high tackle was disqualified. Subsequent high tackles would result in penalty points to the Contender fouled. During Season 4, a variant of the game was played, known as Super Powerball. For the 2008 revival, the game was expanded to 60 seconds, with the Powerball field being enclosed by barriers, removing the 'out of bounds' zone. The contender safety zone, while present, was not enforced strictly. Several Gladiators were given warnings about encroaching into the safety zone, but none were disqualified. 2 points were awarded for an outer basket score and 3 for a central score. The scoring pods themselves were enlarged which allowed contenders to try to score by throwing the balls. Additionally, Gladiators were forced to play a zone defense scheme, but this rule, like the safety zone rule, was not enforced strictly. In the second series of the revival, the scoring pods were made smaller to reduce the chance of contenders scoring by throwing. Only 1 point would be awarded for an outer basket score and 2 for the central basket. Despite being a staple event in America for some years, Powerball did not debut until the second series of the British run, quickly becoming a staple of the British series. The Gladiators teams would enter the arena to certain themes  'We Are Family' by Sister Sledge for the women, and 'The Boys Are Back in Town' by Thin Lizzy for the men. From Series 5, the male team entered the arena to a re-recording of 'The Boys Are Back in Town', sung by the Gladiators themselves. From Series 6, contenders were allowed to wear chest guards, similar to the ones used in Gauntlet, in order to reduce the risk of injuries. From Series 7, the rules were changed, with only two Gladiators now facing the contenders. The Gladiators now had an assigned contender and could not tackle the other without risking disqualification. The entrance themes were changed too, with the female team entering to 'Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves' by Eurythmics and the male team entering to 'Let's Get Ready To Rumble' by Ant & Dec. For the 2008 revival, contenders would receive 5 points for a score in the central basket. The baskets themselves being much larger compared to the previous series, allowing contenders to throw the balls in. The Gladiators no longer walk onto the Powerball pitch with a theme playing. Two of the Gladiators ould be pre-assigned contenders with the third guarding the middle. In the second revival series, the holes on the scoring pods were made smaller and the playing field bigger. The third Gladiator is also allowed to play a much more active role rather than acting as a backup. During the original run, Powerball was played for 60 seconds. For the 2008, revival Powerball was played for 45 seconds, with the challengers wearing chest guards in order to reduce the likelihood of injuries. During the revival, Angel became the only female Gladiator never to play Powerball. Gladiators Zone  Powerball"

Briscoe studied Law at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, financing her studies by having several jobs at weekends and during the holidays, including working with the terminally ill in a hospice. She took an MA at the University of Warwick and holds a Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Wolverhampton.[1] She was called to the Bar in 1983, and in 1996 became a Recorder, a part time judge - one of the first black women to sit as a judge in the UK. Briscoe\'s legal practice focuses on criminal law and fraud, principally defending. She also undertakes tribunal work, public inquiries, inquests and acts as President of Mental Health Tribunals.[2] A room is now named after her in the Newcastle University Students\' Union building. In 2007 she applied to be made a QC but was turned down.[3] In October 2012 Briscoe was suspended from the judiciary after having been arrested and questioned by police.[4] Born to two immigrants from Jamaica who settled in the United Kingdom in the 1950s, she was one of eleven children.[2] Constance\'s mother Carmen had seven children, including Constance, by her husband George Briscoe. She then had another four children by Garfield Eastman.[3] Briscoe is known for her books Ugly and Beyond Ugly in which she claims she was abused as a child, which her mother denied. She often talks publicly about her experiences. Her mother, Carmen Briscoe-Mitchell, sued her daughter and her publishers Hodder & Stoughton for libel.[5] The case was concluded in Briscoe\'s favour, when a jury in the High Court unanimously accepted Constance\'s argument that her allegations were substantially true.[6] Briscoe lives in Clapham, with her two children from her earlier relationship, with lawyer Adam Wilson.[3] A long relationship with barrister Anthony Arlidge ended in 2010.[7] She underwent facial and other cosmetic surgery because she perceived herself to be ugly.[3] On 6 October 2012, Briscoe was arrested in Clapham and subsequently bailed pending further enquiries, as a result of a police investigation. No announcement was made at that time as to the nature of any allegations against her.[4][8] The Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor have suspended Briscoe from the judiciary pending the outcome of the police investigation.[4][8] In February 2013, at the trial of Vicky Pryce police stated that Briscoe\'s arrest related to the release of information to the press on behalf of Vicky Pryce contrary to statements Briscoe had made, and the police could not rely upon Briscoe as a "witness of truth". Pryce was a friend and neighbour of Briscoe. Briscoe had not been charged but remained on police bail.[9][10][11] On 12 June 2013 it was announced she would be charged with two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice and will attend court on 24 June 2013. The first count alleges she provided police with two inaccurate statements, and the second alleges that she produced a copy of her witness statement that had been altered.[12]'

aS'On an English, Scottish or Welsh estate, a dower house is usually a moderately large house available for use by the widow of the estate-owner. The widow, often known as the "dowager", usually moves into the dower house from the larger family house on the death of her husband if the heir is married, and upon his marriage if he was single at his succession. The new heir occupies the now vacated principal house. The dower house might also be occupied by an elder son after his marriage, or simply rented to a tenant.[1] The British royal family maintains a dower house in London as well as one in the country. Well-known royal dower-houses in London have included Clarence House, Marlborough House, and (for a time during the 18th century) Buckingham Palace (then known as "Buckingham House").[2] Frogmore House has served as Windsor Castle\'s dower house.'

aS'ALROSA (Russian:    ), is a diamond company in Russia. Alrosa is engaged in the exploration, mining, manufacture and sale of diamonds. The company\'s operations are located primarily in the Sakha Republic/Yakutsk region. The company\'s headquarters are in Mirny (Sakha Republic) and Moscow. The company was set up according to Presidential Decree 158C of the President of Russia "On the Establishment of the Almazy Rossii-Sakha Joint Stock Company" signed on 19 February 1992, as the legal successor to the following entities: On March 28, 1998, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed the Law On Precious Metals and Stones - a document of vital importance to Alrosa, according to the company\'s website.[1] On July 2007 Verkhne-Munskoye diamond field in Yakutia was discovered with estimated value of about $3.5 billion. In August 2009 during the recent financial crisis, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced the Russian government, via Gokhran, would buy $1 billion in uncut diamonds from Alrosa.[2] This was to support the Russian diamond mining industry while avoiding saturation in the global diamond market and thus further depression of diamond prices.[2] The diamond mining industry is critical to the Yakutia economy.[2] Alrosa is active in diamond mining in Angola and Namibia. Alrosa is notably active in other mining activities including oil exploration; natural gas production; and gold mining in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan through Celtic Resources Holdings of Dublin, Ireland. "ALROSA...has remained opposed to the attempt to control conflict diamonds and is suspected of violating the terms of the Kimberly Process"[3] The Supervisory Board of Alrosa carries out overall guidance of the Company and consists of 15 members, including seven representatives of governmental authorities of the Russian Federation, five representatives of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), two representatives of the Companys employees, and one representative of the local districts (uluses)  co-founders of the Company. Document trail showed that ALROSA\'s Luxembourg-registed subsidiary Alrosa Finance was partially owned by Shapburg Limited and Quenon Investments Limited.

aS'The Business Transformation Agency (BTA) was an organization of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) responsible for guiding the Departments business operations modernization. The BTA was active from 2005 and until its closure in 2011. The agency aimed to foster business operations support for the American warfighter and seeks to provide accountability to the American taxpayer by systematically improving DoDs business processes, ERP systems and investment governance. Aiming to provide consistency, consolidation and coordination across the Department of Defense, the BTA produces the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP)an integrated and executable roadmap that observes the standards laid out in the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA). The ETP and the BEA aimed to transform DoD business operations to achieve improved warfighter support while enabling financial accountability across the Department of Defense. The Business Transformation Agency was established by Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon R. England on October 7, 2005.[1] The founding executives of the BTA were Co-DirectorsThomas Modly, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Financial Management, and Paul Brinkley, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Business Transformation; Director of Transformation Planning and Performance, David Fisher; Director of Transformation Priorities and Requirements, Radha Sekar; Director; Director of Investment Management, Paul Ketrick; Director of Warfighter Support, Bob Love; Director of Information and Federation Management, David Scantling; and Director of Agency Operations, Navy Captain Michael Murphy. In August 2010, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates directed the inactivation of the BTA. The disestablishment of the agency was to be completed by September 2011. In his speech, Secretary Gates said "The Business Transformation Agency was formally established in 2006 to foster the reform and modernization of this department\'s business practices. Since its creation, BTA, an agency that now employs approximately 360 people and spends $340 million a year, has shifted more of its focus to day-to-day oversight of individual acquisition programs, a function that can be performed by a number of other organizations. Furthermore, the mission assigned to BTA has largely been legislatively assigned to other elements of the department."[2] In the last decades of the 20th century, the Department of Defense business model was configured to support a military dependent on large-scale weapons systems and prepared for sustained, predictable battlefield engagements in specific parts of the world. With the challenges that face the U.S. military in the 21st century, the DoD seeks to allow the defense business enterprise to adapt, flex, and react effectively to the needs of its modern joint warfighter. Transformation seeks to make DoD business operations more agile, lean and rapid. The Department calls its approach to this federatedmeaning that uniformed and civilian leadership at all levels in the DoD are accountable for transformation progress. This effort was announced to be structured to support four strategic objectives: The Defense Business Systems Management Committee, chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, leads the Transformation endeavor. The BTA serves as a catalyst for transformation by coordinating and integrating transformation activity at the DoD enterprise level. The BTA was divided into 8 directorates organized around the functions of supporting defense business transformation. Overseeing these directorates was Director David M. Fisher, author of Optimize Now (or else!) (ISBN 0-595-29837-0), a guide to successful organizational transformation. The DBSAE provided direct oversight of 27 department-wide ERP programs. Notable among these programs are the Defense Travel System (DTS), the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) and the Federal Voting Assistance Program (FVAP). EI worked to ensure fast adoption of DoD-wide information and process standards as defined in the BEA. They sought to eliminate burdensome processes that hinder successful, speedy deployment of ERP capabilities within the DoD components. EP&I provided investment management leadership for DoD Enterprise-level business systems. It coordinates the efforts of DoD\'s acquisition policy as outlined in the DoD 5000 series pertaining to business systems. The Directorate also provides input for the Quadrennial Defense Review. EP&I is responsible for the Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA), the Enterprise Transition Plan (ETP), and the March Congressional Report (MCR). EP&I was the result of a merger of the former directorates Transformation Priorities & Requirements and Investment Management. P&R-FM was the primary link to the Principal Staff Assistants within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and other DoD-level organizations; in particular the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and Office of the Secretary of Defense (Comptroller). They ensured that the financial visibility priorities and requirements of these client organizations are reflected in the BEA and ETP, and in the guidance for business system investment management. P&R-HRM was the primary link to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) regarding all human resource management related transformation activities. They aligned functional priorities and requirements of these client organizations in the BEA and ETP, and in the guidance for business system investment management. P&R-SCM served as the primary link to the Principal Staff Assistants within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and other DoD-level organizations as they relate to Supply Chain Management. They ensure that functional priorities Material Visibility, Common Supplier Engagement, Acquisition Visibility, and Real Property Accountability are reflected in the BEA and the ETP, and in the guidance for business system investment management. WR identified and resolved urgent DoD business issues that are directly affecting the troops. The WR also serves as an advocate for soldiers within the BTA. WR projects included economic roundtables that brought together organizations responsible for Mideast economic redevelopment with personnel who are about to be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. These roundtables established a working relationship that can be continued once they are deployed. The office of the Chief of Staff provided operational support for the employees at the BTA. This includeed sections managing personnel, pay, planning, budgeting, infrastructure, IT, and internal management activities. '

Currently in its ninth season, TRD hosts monthly flat-track roller derby competitions which showcase bouts among the various teams in the league. As of 2012, five teams comprise Tucson Roller Derby. The Furious Truckstop Waitresses (FTW), VICE Squad, and the Copper Queens comprise the three home teams. In addition to the home teams, the Saddletramps travel for inter-league challenges. TRD formed a second travel team in 2012, the Bandoleras. The Iron Curtain home team was disbanded after the 2009 season. Initially formed as the Tucson extension of the Phoenix-based Arizona Roller Derby, TRD was founded in 2003 by Kim Kysar (aka Kim Sin) when the Tucson skaters, citing geographical and logistical concerns, broke away from the parent league. At the time of the split, Tucson Roller Derby consisted of one team, The Furious Truckstop Waitresses (FTW). Since that time, Tucson Roller Derby has more than doubled in size, adding the Iron Curtain as a regular-season team in 2004, the Vice Squad in 2005, and the Copper Queens in 2007. TRD continues to have a "sisterly" relationship with AZRD, often facing off against each other with both their local-season and WFTDA inter-league teams. As one of the longest-established flat-track leagues, TRD has kept a high-profile in the Women\'s Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA) since the consortium\'s inception. Tucson had the honor of hosting the first-ever WFTDA National Championship Tournament over the weekend of February 2426, 2006. Dubbed the "Dust Devil", the event hosted 20 WFTDA leagues from around the United States in a tournament to determine the nation\'s first-ever WFTDA national champion team. Due to the success of the first Dust Devil, TRD was chosen to host the 2007 WFTDA Western Regional Tournament. This second Dust Devil, featuring teams west of the Mississippi River, determined the 4 leagues to head to the Texas Shootout National Tournament in Austin, TX, where they faced off against the top 4 teams from the East.

aS'Car free walking is a movement in the United Kingdom that aims to encourage people who take recreational walks to use public transport instead of a car to get to their starting point. Car free walking was created to encourage walkers to use public transport rather than using cars to reach the start of a walk. This is to reduce the number of cars in the countryside, particularly in National Parks, which can cause congestion and inappropriate parking.[1] It is also to support bus and train services in rural areas. Encouraging people not to use their cars is also one of the key aspects of efforts to combat climate change caused through greenhouse gas emissions. Car free walking has environmental benefits, because it encourages people not to use a car and provides information on how to do this. It also supports public transport in rural areas. The benefits for the walker include the opportunity to walk linear routes that start and finish in different places and the chance to have a drink at the end of the walk without then having to drive. Many of the walking routes suggest a pub at the end of the walk. Many organisations encourage their members to use public transport when walking. Prominent supporters of this approach include: Car Free Walks is an internet-based project to collect car-free walking routes from around the UK. People can find car-free walks throughout the UK or add their own walks. Car Free Walks is part of the growing car-free movement around the world. The website was created in September 2007 by a group of keen walkers based in Brighton, UK. Because the group are based in Brighton, many of the walks currently on the website are in East Sussex and the South Downs. There are also a lot of car free walks in the Lake District. The website is free to use. Anyone can search for car free walks throughout the UK. Registered members can contribute walking routes or comment on existing routes. The routes can be viewed online or downloaded as a printer friendly version. Users can get up to date information about public transport to and from the walk as the website links to the Transport Direct website. There are many websites describing walks in a particular region or from a particular railway line. These include: There are several books of car free walking routes. 1.

aS'Charlie Green was an American jazz musician, who was born in Omaha, Nebraska in circa 1900, and died in 1936 in New York. He was one of the early jazz trombonists, and the soloist in the Fletcher Henderson orchestra (joining slightly before Louis Armstrong). He played locally in Omaha between 1920 and 1923, before his two stints with Henderson (July 1924 and April 1926; and late 1928 to early 1929). Described as "A superior blues player who could also swing fairly early", Green played on several Bessie Smith recordings,[1]notably "Trombone Cholly" featuring his trombone, along with biographical lyrics praising his playing. Green also recorded in the 1920s with several other blues singers, and also worked with the bands of Benny Carter (19291931 and 1933), Chick Webb (several times during 1930-1934), Jimmie Noone (1931), Don Redman (1932), and at the end with Kaiser Marshall. In 1928 Green played in the orchestra of the revue Keep Shufflin\' together with Fats Waller and James P. Johnson. According to jazz historian John Chilton (in his book Who\'s Who of Jazz) Green\'s premature death was from passing out on his doorstep in Harlem on a cold February night after having been unable to get into his home, and thus freezing to death.[2] This story was disputed by Frederick J. Spencer, M.D., in his book Jazz and Death, Medical Profiles of Jazz Greats.'

It can be driven in electric-only mode or electric + pedal power mode (pedaling extends the range of the vehicle but does not substantially add to the vehicle\'s top speed). Constructed of lightweight materials such as aluminium and plastic, this 246kg (542lb) (unladen) tricycle vehicle uses a lithium-mangan battery. Ranges of 300 miles are posible. Additional energy is reclaimed while driving through regenerative braking, and load is removed from the electric system by use of the pedalling system which transfers its input directly to the drivetrain (i.e., both systems operate in parallel, not in series). TWIKE owners, who often refer to themselves as TWIKE pilots, host periodic gatherings and tours in Europe and the United States to popularize the vehicle and celebrate its driving experience, which enthusiasts describe as an entertaining form of cardio-vascular exercise. The Swiss TWIKE KLUB is as well active in organizing events. In motion, the TWIKE is controlled using a single joystick, more akin to the tiller on a sailboat than a computer \'drive-by-wire\' joystick. It is generally capable of speeds up to 85 kilometers per hour (53mph). Fully charged, the vehicle is capable of travelling between over 300 miles per charge, depending on terrain, speed, driving style, weight of passengers and cargo, and of course the amount of pedaling by the pilot and passenger. The TWIKE\'s on-board computer controls all aspects of battery charging, discharging and power utilization. Modification of user-controllable system parameters can significantly affect performance, yielding faster or slower acceleration and longer or shorter ranges (American TWIKE enthusiasts have reported achieving speeds in excess of 105km/h (65mph)). In the United Kingdom, a kWh of electricity costs between about 4 pence (overnight, where the home is one of the 20% on "off-peak" two-rate tariffs) and 17 pence (daytime) (average: 7 pence using fuzzy math, 10.5 pence normally), meaning a full charge of a standard two-battery TWIKE would cost about 21-31 pence. In the United States, a kWh of electricity costs generally 10 cents, subject to change, meaning a full charge would cost 30 to 45 cents (this calculation requires using an assumption of combined efficiency of the battery accepting charge and the charger providing charge to fall within the range of: 73% to 110% for the 3.3 KWH battery or; 133% to 200% for the 6 KWH battery). If variable rate electric plans are available with reduced rates at non-peak hours (typically in the wee hours of the morning), overnight kWh rates can be as low as 1-3 cents (US),[1][2] thus a full charge could be had for as little as 3-9 cents. To compare to refueling a gasoline-powered car, filling up a Twike to go the equivalent miles of a \'tank full\' of gas in a 4-door car (8 charge cycles would equal approximately 300 miles (480km), or \'a tankful\' on an average sedan, since a two-battery TWIKE has a range of up to 40 miles (64km)) would cost at: Calculations made from data from the UK TWIKE site on August 6, 2007. Monetary conversions to US$ on August 28, 2007. -> This calculation is out of date (based on the former Nickel Cadium batteries) because there are much better batteries available based on Lithium-Manganese. The TWIKE is currently being manufactured in Germany by FINE Mobile GmbH and may be driven on public roads by drivers with a full driving license. In the United States, there are approximately 20-25 TWIKEs,[3][4] with at least 10 TWIKES currently in operation.[5] The TWIKE is registered with the US DOT as a motorcycle, and thus is legal to import or to drive anywhere motorcycles may be ridden. This is a Federal designation, which applies in all 50 of the United States. Import to Canada and Mexico is possible, pending government approval in those countries or an equivalent NAFTA ruling. The 2007 Neiman Marcus Christmas Book offered the TWIKE for sale. Their exclusive edition featured a sporty British racing green exterior to balance its silver-grey interior, velour carpeting, and leather seats. ($40,000; page 89) Normal pricing for a TWIKE starts at about 25.000  (basic version, two battery packs included). More than 1000 TWIKEs have been sold, most of them operating on the streets of Switzerland and Germany. They are also driven in the United Kingdom, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Spain, Belgium, Morocco, Canada, Australia and the United States.[3] The TWIKE I was developed for the 1986 World EXPO in Vancouver, Canada by a group of Swiss students. It won the "Functionality Award" for the best ergonomic design in the Innovative Vehicle Design Competition (IVDC) and a first prize in the International Human Powered Vehicle Speed Championship . The TWIKE I was completely driven by human power. Inspired by the success of the TWIKE I, a group of enthusiasts including Ralph Schnyder and Peter Zeller began to develop the TWIKE II as a step towards a vehicle for everyday road use. It was developed in cooperation with Alusuisse-Lonza Services, has been shown on the HEUREKA exhibition in Zrich, and took part in the 1991 Tour de Sol Alpin. The TWIKE II featured a belt pedal drive with infinitely variable mechanical transmission and a DC motor powered by NiCd batteries to help propel the vehicle. The suitability for everyday use turned out to be significantly improved. In 1992, the newly founded TWIKE Ltd. decided to develop the TWIKE II into a production vehicle and began looking for capital and customers. Production of the TWIKE III began in 1995 and during 1996 the now reformed TWIKE AG produced and sold 190 vehicles, mostly in Switzerland and Germany. The TWIKE III was already equipped with an asynchronous AC motor and 336V NiCd batteries - the system that is still in use today. The pedal drive was simplified to a 5-speed hub gear and was included in all but very few special order vehicles. In 1998, FINE Mobile GmbH launched its German TWIKE production line and finally became the exclusive producer of the TWIKE after taking over the rights of the SwissLEM AG in 2002. Today the TWIKE is produced in Rosenthal, a small village in Hessen near Marburg. In the same city, team TW4XP announced their entry into the Automotive X Prize with their Twike-based TW4XP human-electric hybrid vehicle.[7]'

aS'Jonathan May (October 9, 1958  February 27, 2010) was an American cellist and conductor. He resided in the Orlando, Florida area and was noted for founding and directing numerous youth orchestras and music programs throughout the region. One of seven children, May was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin to Walter and Eleanor May, each an accomplished musician and teacher. Jonathan would learn to play the cello at a young age, and after the family moved, he would spend his formative years in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He earned a bachelor\'s degree at Augustana College in Sioux Falls, where his father was chairman of the music department.[1] During this time, he met his future wife, Maureen Getting, also an accomplished cellist and student of his mother. Jonathan received his master\'s degree at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, where he and Maureen would begin a lifelong pursuit of teaching music that would take them across the country. The May family moved to Central Florida in the early 1990s, where Jonathan would join the faculty of Stetson University in DeLand. As his reputation as a music teacher in the region grew, he was made Artistic Director of the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra in 1994.[2] When May assumed artistic control of the 90-piece youth orchestra, it consisted of two orchestras of students representing 45 schools from eight counties in Central Florida; just three years later the orchestra grew to over 200 students and four divisions ranging from beginner to a top-level symphony.[3][4] In 1997, he would lead the orchestra on a tour of Australia, which culminated in a performance at the Sidney Opera House. The same year May would also help form and lead the Daytona Beach Youth Orchestra at Daytona Beach Community College, where he was also a professor.[5] May would continue successfully leading the FSYO until 1998, when a split occurred among orchestra board members over the artistic direction of the orchestra.[6] May was reportedly forced out of critical artistic choices by some FSYO board members that sought to override his artistic direction and exclude him from the orchestra\'s audition process. As May would explain to the Orlando Sentinel: "What this is is a difference of philosophy. One is a strong musical director with a supporting board; the other is a weak musical director and a strong board calling the shots."[6] Not content with assuming the role of a weak musical director, May would form a competing orchestra with former FSYO board members and supporters.[6] Though this period marked a fractious time for the youth orchestra movement in Central Florida, with some patrons claiming there were not enough students, venues, or funding to support another youth orchestra in the Orlando area, May remained undaunted and would answer these concerns with his familiar humor and a prophetic movie quote: If you build it, they will come. May founded the Florida Young Artists Orchestra in 1998 in Orlando. May\'s leadership helped oversee its growth into five separate orchestras composed of about 200 students (ages 622) from several Central Florida counties. He was also the founder and director of the strings program at Park Maitland School in Maitland, Florida and Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park, Florida, where he was also the composition teacher. What began as a strings program started by May in 1994 would become the Central Florida Youth Orchestra in 2001, which met at Lake-Sumter Community College in Leesburg; May served as Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the group of young musicians aged 6-19 spanning beginner, intermediate, and advanced ability.[7] In just a few years the orchestra would grow to five groups and increasingly become known for its inclusiveness, as no student was denied the opportunity to learn music, as well as Mays relentless efforts to raise awareness about the value of an orchestral education to children of the Central Florida community.[8] As dedicated member of the Central Florida community, May devoted a great deal of his time bringing music to those that might not otherwise have the opportunity. Like he did in Lake County, May would form an orchestral program in Flagler County where none had existed previously. Beginning in 2001 as a small strings program of a dozen musicians known as the Flagler Symphonic Society, with the help of Flagler County school system the program grew in 2005 into the Flagler Youth Orchestra of Palm Coast, Florida. May served as Artistic Director of the after-school music-education program, which was available free of charge to all Flagler County public, private and home-schooled students.[9] May would lead 125 students in the first year and the program would quickly grow to become the largest performing arts program in Flagler County, with routine enrollment of 300 or more students every year.[10][11] Mays reputation for inclusiveness and excellence in music education would continue to grow each year and with each new orchestra and music program he founded. Under his guidance, and as part of his desire to provide students with the most comprehensive orchestra experience, Mays orchestras often performed with professional guest soloists and in venues across the globe, including in Australia, England, Scotland, throughout Austria, in major Italian venues in Milan, Fiesole, and at the Academy of Music at Santa Cecelia.[12][8][13][14] May also worked with professional orchestras in Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, and Florida and returned to Prague as guest conductor of that city\'s Symphony Orchestra. On Sunday, June 15, 2008 (Father\'s Day), May would take 110 student musicians from all his orchestras to perform on the most revered stage in music, the Isaac Stern Auditorium / Ronald O. Perelman Stage of Carnegie Hall in New York City, as part of the venue\'s Ensemble Spotlight Series.[15][16] Members from the Central Florida Youth Orchestra, Daytona Beach Youth Orchestra, Flagler Youth Orchestra, and Florida Young Artists Orchestra would combine to form the Florida Festival Youth Orchestra. May appeared with the orchestra on the CBS Early Show and the trip culminated with orchestra performing before a large, enthusiastic crowd in Carnegie Hall. May conducted the orchestra as they performed three works commissioned especially for the event: The Phoenix Rising by Stella Sung, Alligator Songs by May\'s brother, composer Daniel May, and The Ponce De Leon Suite by Robert Kerr. The orchestra would receive several standing ovations throughout the program. Always conscious of the difficulties of funding the arts but never doubting the need to do so, May and his orchestras sought to raise money for their trip by doing what they did best and holding performances for the community, as he told the press: Selling cookies is not what we do. If people wonder why this is a worthy cause, they can come and listen.[17] On February 26, 2010 Jonathan Paul May suffered a sudden brain bleed and died at 2:45pm the next afternoon, February 27, 2010, age 51. His public memorial at Northland Church in Longwood, Florida was attended by over 1,700 admirers, friends, students and colleagues. He had four children, Emily (b. 1987), Elliot (b. 1988), Allison (b. 1990), and Nathan (b. 1994), and was married to Maureen May, a cellist with the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bach Festival, as well as a teacher of strings at Millennium Middle School and Trinity Preparatory School.[9] The last piece May ever conducted was Dona nobis pacem (Grant Us Peace) with the students at Park Maitland. During Mays quarter century as a music professional and teacher, he worked with orchestras all over the world as both a musician and conductor.[1] May was the Artistic Director of the Academy of Music at Schloss-Ort, Gmunden, Upper Austria, where he performed as cellist and conductor. He was also recognized by his peers and several organizations for his superior work, including winning the Teachers Who Make a Difference Award, and an ASCAP award at the American Symphony Orchestra League\'s annual conference. In addition to his orchestras and programs, May maintained a private studio and all tolled taught well over 1,000 students each week. Known to his students and colleagues as a magnetic personality who was always quick with a joke or bad pun, his passion for educating students of music was infectious. Referred to as the Johnny Appleseed of music[1] by his brother, composer Daniel May, he sought to create musical opportunities for students wherever he saw an opening. May would not only create a large number of youth orchestras and music programs in Florida, but would also inspire other musicians and music teachers to do the same, leading directly to the creation of orchestras all over the country.[18] In the often-political world of youth orchestras, he retained an insouciance and positive attitude that allowed him to focus on the music education of his students over politics or status. May was well known for a motto, often used as a mantra to help educate his students about dealing with musical changes: You must he would say. Adjust!" they would respond.[1] As with all of May\'s musical lessons, these words would apply as much to life as to music. Since May\'s death, many Central Florida concerts and performances have been dedicated to his honor. The Central Florida Youth Orchestra, the Flagler Youth Orchestra, and the Trinity Prep Theater Department all dedicated performances to May.[19][20][21] The Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra (OPO) also dedicated the first number of its Myth and Poetry program on November 1, 2010 to May; The Phoenix Rising, composed by Mays friend and OPOs composer-in-residence Stella Sung, was originally commissioned by May for his youth orchestra. Upon completion of the emotional piece, OPO conductor Christopher Wilkins embraced Maureen May, who plays cello in the orchestra.[22] Additional tributes to May have been planned by the CFYO, the FYO, and the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony.[11] May 1st has been designated by the government of Orange County, Florida as Mr. Jonathan May Day.[23] The first celebration was held May 1, 2010 at Trinity Preparatory School in Winter Park, Florida, and events are planned annually in Central Florida to honor and celebrate May\'s love and lifelong commitment to music education. On May 14, 2011, the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra honored May at its concert featuring violinist Joshua Bell with the world premiere performance of a commissioned work by May\'s brother, Daniel. The piece, Tall and Small, was named to reflect the wide impact May\'s passion for music had on children and adults alike. The professional OPO musicians were joined onstage by 30-35 student musicians of all skill levels that worked with or were inspired by May.[24] The Make Music-Make History competition continued through April 1, 2011 with live audition recordings conducted by the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony in March.[25][26] The sold-out concert began with the The Tall and the Small, a 12-minute piece that the Orlando Sentinel reviewed as reminiscent of that moment when the sun emerges after a long stretch of rain.[27] The OPO was accompanied by a 36-member youth ensemble that featured two of Mays children, as well as his wife, Maureen, who was seated in front of the orchestra and played an emotional cello solo on Jonathans cello.[27] In 2012, tributes to Jonathan May continued to be made throughout Central Florida. The CFYO renamed its annual season finale concert MAYFEST to serve as a tribute to its former leader. After honoring Mays memory in 2011 with a February 28 performance at the cold-weather shelter at First United Methodist Church in Bunnell, Florida, the Flagler Youth Orchestra honored Mays memory in 2012 with a day-long tour of assisted and independent living facilities in Palm Coast on the weekend before Jonathan May Day.[10] In 2010, May was named as honorary founder of the Metropolitan Area Youth Symphony (MAYS) in the Orlando area, founded by his wife, Maureen, and longtime friend, colleague, and fellow conductor, Michael Miller of The Geneva School in Winter Park, with his daughter Emily serving as program organizer. The MAYS sets out to continue May\'s inclusive music educational philosophy, and states about him on the orchestra website: "The MAYS is dedicated to his honor and maintaining the high musical, educational, and ethical ideals that he brought with him to each of his orchestras and students.[10] The Jonathan May Foundation was formed in 2012 to encourage participation in youth orchestra by providing scholarships and assistance to MAYS and the students in all of its orchestras and programs. The nonprofit foundation sponsors free MAYS concerts throughout the season, as well as the season finale MAYSfest, which features all the students from each MAYS orchestra and program.[28]'

aS'Justin Parker is an English songwriter and record producer best known for his work with female singer-songwriters such as Lana Del Rey and Ellie Goulding. Parker began writing music when he was 17, but his career breakthrough came when he started working with Lana Del Rey in February 2011. Together they wrote "Video Games", the song that would launch both of their careers. Although label executives were unimpressed with the song, it became a viral hit after Del Rey posted the song online which led to Fearne Cotton playing the song on BBC Radio 1.[1] Del Rey then asked Parker to work on her album. The pair wrote 12 songs together, five of which ended up on Born to Die.[2] In 2012, Parker co-wrote the lead single "Ride", for Del Rey\'s Paradise. Also in 2012, Parker co-wrote the lead single "Laura" for Bat for Lashes\' third album, The Haunted Man,[3] and the song "I Know You Care" for Ellie Goulding\'s second album, Halcyon. Parker was reported in 2012 to be working with Lissie and Eliza Doolittle on future projects.[4] '

aS'The ABS Loan-Level Initiative was begun following support at a European Central Bank (ECB) public consultation.[1] It establishes specific information requirements for asset-backed securities (ABSs) accepted as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations. The aim is to allow market participants access to standardised timely information on loans and their performance. Access to this information should allow market actors to make more informed assessments of asset backed securities. The Eurosystem believes that the new data requirements will help both investors and third-party assessment providers with their due diligence. It is hoped that the loan level initiative will help instil transparency and ultimately confidence back into the securitisation market Following the ECB initiative, the Bank of England has made Loan Level information one of their extended eligibility criteria for ABS collateral, but without a costly central Data Warehouse and with free access to market participants.[2] Following the 2008 financial crisis the ECB wanted to restore confidence in the securitisations market. The perceived problems were a lack of transparency and the absence of a standardised system across asset classes. These made it difficult to make accurate risk assessments of the securities. Enabling better risk assessment would then have the effect of encouraging investors and reducing the current levels of reliance on the Eurosystem. The officially stated European Central Bank aims of the initiative are [3] The Technical Working Group (TWG) was introduced to provide expert advice on the ABS Loan Level Initiative [4] The TWG is broken up into 6 asset class groups: In addition there is a group of permanent members of the TWG  this group includes representation from:[5] The current chairman of the TWG is Fernando Gonzalez Miranda a representative of the European Central Bank In 2009 the ECB began the project to introduce Loan-Level data reporting for ABS. The ECBs Executive Board and Governing Council worked together so that the 2,084 Billion ABS market in Europe could be promptly restarted. LCM Partners was appointed as the senior advisor from the projects inception. In December 2010 the ECB the Governing Council of the ECB announced its decision to establish loan level data requirements (referred to as the ABS initiative). As of the summer of 2012 the published data requirements will have to be complied with before a financial institution can pledge ABS as collateral with the ECB. These data templates were decided upon following consultation with the Technical Working Groups. The individual asset class requirements were further deliberated by more specialist Technical Working Groups The ECB decided that in order to for the data requirements to work effectively there must be a data-handling infrastructure. In April 2011 in a letter to President Trichet the ECB detailed its plan to develop a European Data Warehouse which would allow for the collection and transmission of the loan level data. LCM Partners carried out surveys with investors and issuers in order to determine the most efficient way of structuring the data-handling infrastructure. Following LCM Partners consultations it was decided that the European Data Warehouse would receive the loan-level data from the originators and would then check it for compliance against the ECB templates. An independent Market Group was established to oversee the Request for Interest and the Request for Proposals. The Market Group is composed of nine of the largest originators and purchasers of ABS in the market. The Market Group oversaw the RfI and RfP and will continue to oversee the development of the European Data Warehouse by working closely with investors and the Technical Working Group. Following the RfI and RfP the Market Group selected the following companies to advise and provide services for the European Data Warehouse: The result of this development work is the European Data Warehouse GmbH. It is ready to go live in 2012 and to begin providing the transparency which the ECB desired in the ABS market. The European Data Warehouse (ED) is an ambitious market led solution to the problems the ECB identified in the ABS market. EDs responsibilities include ensuring that ABS market data is openly accessible and that all transactions are recorded. A key aim of ED to instil trust back into the ABS market which been a problem in recent times.[6] The ECB is set to make compliance with Loan Level Data disclosure compulsory before it will accept ABS securities as collateral for financing. In July 2012 ED announced that it had placed all 15 of the investors it was seeking.[7] This investor group consists largely of global banks and institutions The Bank of England has published similar data templates as the those published by the ECB.[8] In contrast to the ECB, the ABS Loan Level information is also applicable to covered bonds. While the ECB eligibility criteria on Loan Level data will phase in starting from March 2013 (for RMBS), it has been mandatory for the Bank of England since December 2011. Further to Loan Level disclosure, eligibility criteria extend to a standardized transaction overview template and an open source cash flow model to be provided freely to investors and other market participants.'

aS'"Holding On for You" is a song by English-Irish pop group Liberty X. Written by Martin Prime and produced by Tim Laws, it released in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2002 as the fifth and final single from the group\'s debut studio album, Thinking It Over (2002). The single peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the joint third highest charting single from the LP. It was the band\'s first ballad to be released as a single, and despite low airplay, the song was a minor hit across Europe, being successful in Germany and France. The "Single Remix" version of "Holding On for You", known in the United Kingdom, was also issued internationally, under the pseudonym of the "B&Q Mix". The original version of the track appears on To Those Who Wait, the band\'s debut release, exclusively in Japan. The version of the track which features on the British version of the album is slightly different to all of the other versions, and for international releases, this was dubbed the alternative version. An alternative version also appears a bonus track on the band\'s third studio album, X. One of the single\'s B-sides, "So Alive", was never issued on CD in the United Kingdom. The music video for the track was filmed in September 2002, and features each of the five members of the band making their way to the Budapest Underground, from their respective locations. Scenes at the end of the video depict the band leaving the station on separate trains, as to represent the individuality of each of the band members. The video features on the band\'s live DVD, Just a Little: Live at Cardiff Arena, as well as the bonus DVD that accompanied the Australian edition of the band\'s third studio album, X.[1]'

aS'The Seven Crystal Balls (French: Les Sept Boules de Cristal) is the thirteenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, the series of comic albums by Belgian cartoonist Herg. The strange Incan mummy Rascar Capac seems to be at the centre of a mysterious illness, and an intriguing clue is discovered near each victim: shards of crystal balls. Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock set off to rescue the kidnapped Professor Calculus. The story was first serialized in Le Soir Jeunesse, children\'s supplement to Belgium\'s leading newspaper Le Soir, from 16 December 1943 to 3 Sept 1944 but was postponed three-quarters through its serialization. World War II had ended, Belgium had been liberated, and Herg and other members of the Le Soir were being investigated for working for a collaborationist newspaper. Four years later, in 1948, it was published in book form. The Seven Crystal Balls is the first volume in a two-part adventure concluded in Prisoners of the Sun (1949). On board a train, Tintin reads a newspaper article about seven explorers who have returned from a two-year ethnographic expedition in the Andes, where they unearthed the tomb of the Inca, Rascar Capac. A man says to him, "Think of all those Egyptologists, dying in mysterious circumstances after they\'d opened the tomb of the pharaoh...You wait, the same will happen to those busybodies violating the Inca\'s burial chamber." Tintin\'s train arrives at Marlinspike Hall, the new home of his friends Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus. The Captain, now a member of the aristocracy, invites Tintin to an evening at the music hall. There they witness an unsettling performance of a clairvoyant (Madame Yamilah) who predicts the illness of one of the members of the expedition. They also view the act of Bianca Castafiore, as well as a knife throwerwhom Tintin recognizes is General Alcazar (stage name Ramon Zarate) former President of San Theodoros. They have a glass of aguardiente with the general who introduces them to his assistant Chiquito. A mysterious illness begins afflicting the members of the expedition; one by one, they fall into a mysterious coma. The only clue is fragments of a shattered crystal ball found near each victim. Concerned, Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus go to stay with Calculus\'s old friend and only expedition member yet to be affected, the ebullient Professor Hercules Tarragon. Tarragon is keeping Rascar Capac\'s mummy in his house and is being tightly guarded against any attack. A lightning storm strikes the house and sends a ball of fire down the chimney and onto the mummywhich evaporates. Tarragon, clearly shaken, informs them a prophecy has come true: Rascar Capac has returned to his element and punishment will descend upon the desecrators. After Tintin, Captain Haddock, and Professor Calculus are each visited in their nightmares by the mummy, the three awaken to find Professor Tarragon comatose with the telltale shards of crystal by his bed. The attacker bypassed the police watch by coming down the chimney. The police shoot the attacker as he flees, but fail to capture him. Tintin states the crystal balls have done their work and claimed the last of the seven. Tarragon awakens and screams about mysterious figures attacking him, before slipping back into a coma. The plot thickens even further when Calculus takes a stroll around Professor Tarragon\'s house, discovers a striking gold bracelet, puts it on (remarking on how nicely it goes with his coat), and then mysteriously disappears. The bracelet had previously been worn by the now-vanished mummy. While searching the grounds, Tintin and Haddock discover the attacker had eluded them by taking refuge in a tree and deduce that he then jumped Calculus and stole the mummy\'s jewels. Tintin and the Captain are then fired upon by an unseen gunman who escapes, having kidnapped Calculus, in a black car. The alarm is raised and the police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars and slip through the net. Tintin visits a hospital where all seven of the stricken explorers go through the same horrorthey awaken from their coma, scream about figures attacking them, and slip back into their comaat a precise time of day. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock is devastated by the loss of Professor Calculus. But after he receives a telephone call from the police, he disappears into his bedroom, then reappearsdressed as a sailor again and ready for travel. As he and Tintin drive to Westermouth, he explains the kidnapper\'s car was seen there; he believes the kidnappers boarded a ship with Calculus and he intends to follow. When they reach the docks, they find the kidnapper\'s car abandoned and they spot General Alcazar boarding a ship to South America. The General informs them his music hall career is over since the disappearance of his partner, Chiquito, one of the last descendants of the Incas. Tintin realizes Chiquito disappeared the same night Professor Tarragon was attacked and Calculus kidnapped and deduces he could be one of the kidnappers. Out of leads, Tintin and Haddock decide to go to a different dock, Bridgeport, to visit Haddock\'s friend, Captain Chester. Snowy retrieves an old hat found there, and Tintin recognizes it as belonging to Professor Calculus. Checking with the harbour master, they discover that Calculus must be on board the Pachacamac, which is bound for Peru. They board a flight and resolve to meet his ship there. The story is continued in Prisoners of the Sun. The Seven Crystal Balls was written during World War II. With Belgium under German occupation, Herg decided to avoid the overt political content that he had included in previous Tintin stories, such as The Blue Lotus, The Broken Ear and King Ottokar\'s Sceptre. As the opening sequence of the book indicates, The Seven Crystal Balls and its theme of an ancient curse, was inspired by the "curse of the pharaohs", the speculation that members of the Howard Carter expedition, discoverers of the tomb of Tutankhamun, died in tragic and mysterious ways due to a curse. For Professor Tarragon\'s residence, Herg\'s collaborator Edgar P. Jacobs suggested a house he knew in Boitsfort. The two artists went there and made sketches of the house which appeared to be empty. It was only when they were leaving that they realised that the place was actually being used by the local SS and was full of soldiers. However, they were able to slip away without any trouble.[1] The original serial version began regular publication in the Belgian newspaper Le Soir on 16 December 1943. It was suspended on 3 September 1944, following the liberation of Brussels, when Herg and many of his colleagues had to answer for working for the collaborationist newspaper. The strip ended with Tintin walking through the street reading a newspaper when he collides with General Alcazar. Alcazar tells him that he is now unemployed since the disappearance of his assistant Chiquito and how Chiquito is in fact a descendant of the Incas.[1] Tintin then describes to him the man who was driving the car in which Calculus is believed to have been transferred to during the kidnapping. Alcazar identifies him as Fernando Ramirez, a major exporter of guano whom Chiquito knew well. Tintin then rushes him to the police station in order to make a statement. Publication resumed in the newly-launched Tintin Magazine in 1946, under the title Le Temple du Soleil (French for "Temple of the Sun" but renamed Prisoners of the Sun in English). It begins with Tintin on his way to Marlinspike Hall where Haddock is in a state of depression over Calculus\' disappearance. This and his sudden leap into action is said to be reflecting Herg\'s mood at the time: his uncertain future due to the accusations of collaboration and the subsequent offer to help launch Tintin Magazine.[1] (The scene with Alcazar would be re-located to a city port with the General about to set off to South America himself in order to lead an uprising and denying all knowledge of the driver in the car). Tintin telephones Professor Paul Cantonneau to warn him about the danger of falling victim to one of the crystal balls. He and Tintin had known each other in the expedition of The Shooting Star: Cantonneau had been on the receiving end of Tintin\'s suitcase, thrown down from the crow\'s nest by Philippulus the prophet. The nightmare of a South American native stalking a Westerner in his bedroom had been used before by Herg in the original black-and-white publication of The Broken Ear (though it is not included in the present edition most commonly available today). General Alcazar of The Broken Ear and Bianca Castafiore of King Ottokar\'s Sceptre also appear in the music-hall scenes. For Castafiore, this seems sharply at odds with all her other appearances in the Tintin series, where she is depicted as one of the world\'s leading operatic divas; not a music hall variety act. In a significant continuity error by the translators (which does not occur in the original version), Tintin observes that Castafiore "turns up" in unlikely locations, including "Syldavia, Borduria, and the Red Sea". At this point in the chronology of the series, Tintin has only met Castafiore once before, in Syldavia during the adventure King Ottokar\'s Sceptre. The adventures featuring Castafiore in Borduria (The Calculus Affair) and the Red Sea (The Red Sea Sharks) are in Tintin\'s future. Plus, Haddock appears to know Castafiore, yet he has never encountered her previously in the published series (however, he might have seen her at a previous evening at the Music Hall). Alcazar and Castafiore were to guest-star in other adventures, including Tintin and the Picaros. The two boys, one blonde, the other dark-haired, who hide a brick in a hat as a prank on Captain Haddock, were quite likely inspired by Herg\'s own Quick & Flupke, another pair of young troublemakers. A video game has been released based on this book and Prisoners of the Sun.'

aS'James Elmer Spyglass (November 1, 1877 - February 16, 1957) was a United States consul in Germany. He was born in Springfield, Ohio. In 1897 he became a founding member of St. John\'s Missionary Baptist Church in Springfield. After that, he dedicated his life to music and became a cabaret singer. At the Carnegie Music Hall in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he accompanied a 25 piece orchestra and a 200 member choir in singing Strauss\'s "An der schnen blauen Donau". In 1906, he went to Europe and established himself as an interpreter of "Negro Spirituals". For 20 years, he sang in the Netherlands to cheering audiences. In 1930, he retired to Sachsenhausen, a suburb of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. His house in Sachsenhausen was bombed in 1944. After World War II, Spyglass became an interpreter and receptionist in the US consulate in Frankfurt. His job was to greet visitors to the consulatemany of them intending to become emigrants to the USand to direct them to the appropriate office. Spyglass was fluent in five European languages. In Sachsenhausen he opened up language classes and taught English to local townspeople for a number of years. In 1947, he had an interview with Will Lang Jr. of Life to discuss his life and his role as a receptionist. According to Lang, Spyglass\'s "pleasant coffee-colored face" greeted everyone who came "to do business with the US." Lang mentions that the consul general, Sidney B. Redecker, was one of the few people who addressed the "colored man" by his first name, Elmer. "To others he is known respectfully as \'Mr Spyglass.\'" Will Lang\'s article appeared in Life on November 3, 1947. On November 9, 1954, Spyglass became an honorary citizen of Schwalbach, Germany. On January 8, 1995, a student in Schwalbach was the first to receive the "James Elmer Spyglass Prize" for contributions to intercultural relations.'

aS'San Giorgio in Alga (English: "St. George in the seaweed"[1]) is an island of the Venetian lagoon, northern Italy, lying between the Giudecca and Fusina (a frazione of Venice on the coast, near Marghera). After a Benedictine monastery was founded about 1000 AD, more monasteries followed. In 1404, Ludovico Barbo, the commendatory prior of a monastery of Augustinian friars on the island which was almost abandoned, gave the monastery to a small community of canons leading a contemplative life. The canons of the monastery instituted reforms to the canonical life which were quickly adopted in other communities of canons throughout the region. Soon they became the head of a congregation known as the Canons Regular of San Giorgio in Alga.[2] One of Barbo\'s reforms was to allow the canons to sleep in separate cells to provide more opportunity for solitary prayer.[3] In 1717 a fire burnt most of the buildings on the island. As of 1799 there was a political prison, but nowadays the island is completely abandoned. The island was used in 1944 as a secret base for German military personnel training under the auspices of Italian Lt-Cmdr Wolk to master mine laying against Allied ships as free-diving frogmen. To avoid being discovered they practiced only at night. Coordinates: 452530N 121731E / 45.42500N 12.29194E / 45.42500; 12.29194'

aS'Solar System portal The Solar System\'s planets and officially recognised dwarf planets are known to be orbited by 180natural satellites, or moons. 19moons in the Solar System are large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus would be considered planets or dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. Moons are classed in two separate categories according to their orbits: regular moons, which have prograde orbits (they orbit in the direction of their planets\' rotation) and lie close to the plane of their equators, and irregular moons, whose orbits can be pro- or retrograde (against the direction of their planets\' rotation) and often lie at extreme angles to their planets\' equators. Irregular moons are probably minor planets that have been captured from surrounding space. Most irregular moons are less than 10 kilometres (6.2mi) in diameter. The earliest published discovery of a moon other than the Earth\'s was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons in 1610. Over the following three centuries only a few more moons were discovered. Missions to other planets in the 1970s, most notably the Voyager 1 and 2 missions, saw a surge in the number of moons detected, and observations since the year 2000, using mostly large ground-based optical telescopes, have discovered many more, all of which are irregular.  Mercury, the innermost planet, has no moons, or at least none that can be detected to a diameter of 1.6km (1.0mi).[1] For a brief time in 1974, Mercury was thought to have a moon. Venus has no moons,[2] though reports of a moon around Venus have circulated since the 17th century. Earth has one Moon, the largest moon of any rocky planet in the Solar System. Earth also has at least two co-orbitals: the asteroids 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29;[3] however, since they do not orbit Earth, they are not considered moons. (See Other moons of Earth and Quasi-satellite.) Mars has twoknown satellites, Phobos and Deimos ("fear" and "dread", after attendants of Ares, the Greek god of war, equivalent to the Roman Mars). Searches for more satellites have been unsuccessful, putting the maximum radius of any other satellites at 90m (100yd).[4] Jupiter has 67known moons with secured orbits. Its eightregular moons are grouped into the planet-sized Galilean moons and the far smaller Amalthea group. They are named after lovers of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of Jupiter. Its 59known irregular moons are organized into two categories: prograde and retrograde. The prograde satellites consist of the Himalia group and two others in groups of one. The retrograde moons are grouped into the Carme, Ananke and Pasipha groups, as well as some isolated moons. Saturn has 62moons with confirmed orbits, 53 of which have names, most of which are quite small. Seven moons are large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, including Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System. Twenty-two of Saturn\'s moons are regular, and traditionally named after Titans or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. The remaining thirty-eight, all small, are irregular, and classified by their orbital characteristics into Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies. The rings of Saturn are made up of icy objects ranging in size from one centimetre to hundreds of metres, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet. Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn\'s ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. At least 150"moonlets" embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects. Uranus has 27named moons, five of which are massive enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium. There are 13inner moons that orbit within Uranus\'s ring system, and another nineouter irregular moons. Unlike most planetary moons, which are named from antiquity, all the moons of Uranus are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope\'s work The Rape of the Lock. Neptune has 14named moons; the largest, Triton, accounts for more than 99.5percent of all the mass orbiting the planet. Triton is large enough to have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium, but, uniquely for a large moon, has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it was captured. Neptune also has sixknown inner regular satellites, and sixouter irregular satellites. Among the dwarf planets, Ceres has no known moons. It is 90percent certain that Ceres has no moons larger than 1km in size, assuming that they would have the same albedo as Ceres itself.[5] Pluto has five moons. Its largest moon Charon, named after the ferryman who took souls across the River Styx, is more than half as large as Pluto itself, and large enough to orbit a point outside Pluto\'s surface. In effect, each orbits the other, forming a binary system informally referred to as a double-dwarf-planet. Pluto\'s four other moons, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx are far smaller and orbit the PlutoCharon system. Haumea has two moons, Namaka and Hi\'iaka, of radii ~85 and ~155km, respectively. Makemake has no known moons. A satellite having 1% Makemake\'s brightness would have been detected if it had been located at an angular distance from Makemake farther than 0.4 arcseconds (0.0001 degrees).[6] Eris has one known moon, Dysnomia. Its radius is currently not known, but is expected to be around 100km.[7] As of October 2009, 190asteroid moons[8] and 63 trans-Neptunian moons had been discovered.[8] This is a list of the recognized moons of the planets and of the largest dwarf planets of the Solar System. The 19moons that are large enough to approximate hydrostatic equilibrium are listed in bold. The seven largest moons are listed in bold and italic. Sidereal period differs from semi-major axis because it depends on the mass of the primary as well as the satellite\'s distance from it. Earth Mars Asteroid moons'

aS'The Senkaku Islands dispute concerns a territorial dispute over a group of uninhabited islands known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, the Diaoyu in China,[1] and Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan.[2] Aside from a 1945 to 1972 period of administration by the United States, the archipelago has been controlled by Japan since 1895.[3] The People\'s Republic of China (PRC) disputed the proposed US handover of authority to Japan in 1971[4] and has asserted its claims to the islands since that time.[5] Taiwan (Republic of China) also claims the islands. The territory is close to key shipping lanes and rich fishing grounds, and there may be oil reserves in the area.[6] Japan argues that it surveyed the islands in the late 19th century and found them to be Terra nullius (Latin: land belonging to no one); subsequently, China acquiesced to Japanese sovereignty until the 1970s. The PRC and the ROC argue that documentary evidence prior to the First Sino-Japanese War indicates Chinese possession and that the territory is accordingly a Japanese seizure that should be returned as the rest of Imperial Japan\'s conquests were returned in 1945. Although the United States does not have an official position on the merits of the competing sovereignty claims,[7] the islands are included within the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, meaning that a defense of the islands by Japan would require the United States to come to Japan\'s aid.[8] In September 2012, the Japanese government purchased three of the disputed islands from their private owner, prompting large-scale protests in China.[9] As of early February 2013, the situation has been regarded as "the most serious for Sino-Japanese relations in the post-war period in terms of the risk of militarised conflict."[10] The Senkaku Islands are located in the East China Sea between Japan, the People\'s Republic of China, and the Republic of China. The archipelago contains five uninhabited islands and three barren rocks, ranging in size from 800m2 to 4.32km2. The issue of sovereignty has been carefully circumvented in bilateral fishing agreements. In the 1997 fishing agreement, the Senkaku Islands were officially excluded from China\'s exclusive economic zone, but in a letter of intent Japan explained that Japan would not prevent Chinese boats from fishing there. Some Chinese sources have subsequently argued that this letter constitutes a waiver of Japan\'s claim to exclusive fishing rights.[11] Following the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government formally annexed what was known as the Ryukyu Kingdom as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. The Senkaku Islands, which lay between the Ryukyu Kingdom and the Qing empire, became the Sino-Japanese boundary for the first time.[citation needed] In 1885, the Japanese Governor of Okinawa Prefecture, Nishimura Sutezo, petitioned the Meiji government, asking that it take formal control of the islands.[12] However, Inoue Kaoru, the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, commented that the islands lay near to the border area with the Qing empire and that they had been given Chinese names. He also cited an article in a Chinese newspaper that had previously claimed that Japan was occupying islands off China\'s coast. Inoue was concerned that if Japan proceeded to erect a landmark stating its claim to the islands, it would make the Qing empire suspicious.[12] Following Inoue\'s advice, Yamagata Aritomo, the Minister of the Interior, turned down the request to incorporate the islands, insisting that this matter should not be "revealed to the news media".[12] On 14 January 1895, during the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan incorporated the islands under the administration of Okinawa, stating that it had conducted surveys since 1884 and that the islands were terra nullius, with there being no evidence to suggest that they had been under the Qing empire\'s control.[13] After China lost the war, both countries signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in April 1895 that stipulated, among other things, that China would cede to Japan "the island of Formosa together with all islands appertaining or belonging to said island of Formosa (Taiwan)".[14] The treaty, however, was superseded in 1945 by the Treaty of San Francisco, which was signed between Japan and part of the Allied Powers in 1951 after Japan lost the Second World War. In the treaty of San Francisco, Japan explicitly relinquished the control of Taiwan/Formosa together with all islands appertaining or belonging to it. There is a disagreement between the Japanese, PRC and ROC governments as to whether the islands are implied to be part of the "islands appertaining or belonging to said island of Formosa" in the Treaty of Shimonoseki.[12] China and Taiwan both dispute the Japanese claim by citing Yamagata Aritomo\'s reasons and decisions to turn down the request to incorporate the islands in 1885.[15] Both PRC and ROC asserted sovereignty over the islands.[16] Japan points out that the islands were placed under the administration of the United States of America as part of the Ryukyu Islands, in accordance with Article III of the said treaty and China expressed no objection to the status of the Islands being under the administration of the United States under Article III of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. In 1972, the United States ended its occupation of Okinawa and the Ryukyu Island chain, which included the Senkaku Islands.[17] Korean academic Lee Seokwoo notes that "The significance of subsequent acts and behaviour of the interested parties is dependent upon the determination of the applicable critical date, which is defined as \'the date by reference to which a territorial dispute must be deemed to have crystallized,\' since the outcome of this dispute will be fundamentally different depending on whether the critical date is January 1895, as claimed by Chinese side, when Japan incorporated Senkaku Islands into Japanese territory, or February 1971 in the case of Taiwan, or December 1971 in the case of China, when Japan made known its official standpoint with the signing of the Okinawa Reversion Treaty, as claimed by Japan."[18] He concluded "... Accordingly, and having regard to the various factual and legal issues explored above, one is inclined to conclude that Japan has a stronger claim to the disputed islands. In other words, the critical date in this case should be February 1971 (in the case of Taiwan) and December 1971 (in the case of China), as claimed by Japan. This is the more so that historical evidence relating to territorial disputes does not have its own value as history alone, but should be evaluated within the framework of international law on territorial acquisition and loss."[19] Although Chinese authorities did not assert claims to the islands while they were under US administration, formal claims were announced in 1971 when the US was preparing to end its administration.[22] A 1968 academic survey undertaken by United Nations Economic Council for Asia and the Far East found possible oil reserves in the area which many consider explains the emergence of Chinese claims,[23] a suggestion confirmed by statements made on the diplomatic records of the Japan-China Summit Meeting by Premier Zhou Enlai in 1972.[24] However, supporters of China\'s claim that the sovereignty dispute is a legacy of Japanese imperialism and that China\'s failure to secure the territory following Japan\'s military defeat in 1945 was due to the complexities of the Chinese Civil War in which the Kuomintang (KMT) were forced off the mainland to Taiwan in 1949 by the Chinese Communist Party. Both the People\'s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) respectively separately claim sovereignty based on arguments that include the following points: According to Chinese claims,[25] the islands were known to China since at least 1372,[32] had been repeatedly referred to as part of Chinese territory since 1534,[32] and were later controlled by the Qing Dynasty along with Taiwan.[25] The earliest written record of Diaoyutai dates back to 1403 in a Chinese book Voyage with the Tail Wind (zh:),[33] which recorded the names of the islands that voyagers had passed on a trip from Fujian to the Ryukyu Kingdom.[12] By 1534, all the major islets of the island group were identified and named in the book Record of the Imperial Envoy\'s Visit to Ryukyu ().[27] and were the Ming Dynasty\'s (16th-century) sea-defense frontier.[27][32] One of the islands, Chihweiyu, marked the boundary of the Ryukyu Islands. This is viewed by the PRC and ROC as meaning that these islands did not belong to the Ryukyu Islands.[32] The First Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894 and after the Qing dynasty of China lost the war, both countries signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki on 17 April 1895. In Article 2(b) the Treaty stated that "the island of Formosa, together with all islands appertaining or belonging to the said island of Formosa" should be ceded to Japan.[34] Although the Treaty did not specifically name every ceded island, the PRC and ROC argue that Japan did not include the islands as part of Okinawa Prefecture prior to 1894, and that the eventual inclusion occurred only as a consequence of China\'s cession of Taiwan and the Pescadores to Japan after the Sino-Japanese War.[32] The Japanese government argues that the islands were not ceded by this treaty. In 1884, issues relating to the islands had been officially discussed by the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Inoue Kaoru and the Minister of the Interior Yamagata Aritomo before incorporating them in 1895.[15][25][27] shortly before Japan\'s victory in the Sino-Japanese War.[32] It is also claimed that Japanese references to these islands did not appear in governmental documents before 1884.[32] The PRC and ROC governments claim that during negotiations with China over the Ryukyu Islands after the First Sino-Japanese War, the islands were not mentioned at all in a partition plan suggested by US ex-President Grant.[32] The lease of the islands in 1896 and subsequent purchase in 1930 by the Koga family were merely domestic arrangements made by the Japanese government which had no bearing on the legal status of the islands."[32] According to PRC, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek failed to protest American decisions with regard to the disposition of the islands because he depended on the US for support.[6] In April 2012, Taiwan declined an invitation from the PRC to work together to resolve the territorial dispute with Japan. Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Lai Shin-yuan said, "The ROC and Mainland China will not deal with the [Tiaoyutai Islands] disputes together. Mainland China said the two sides should solve these issues together, but that is not the approach we are taking because [Taiwan and Mainland China] already have sovereignty disputes. We insist on our sovereignty."[35] Regarding Japan\'s argument about the 1953 People\'s Daily, Jin Canrong, a professor at Renmin University of China thinks that the article, which is anonymous, implies that Ryukyu Islands should be a sovereign state, also independent from Japan.[36] Other Chinese commentators, including a government research institution run by a retired People\'s Armed Police general,[37] extend the Chinese claim to the entire Ryukyu chain, including Okinawa.[38] In June 2013, The New York Times described the Chinese campaign "to question Japanese rule of [Okinawa and the Ryukyu] islands" as "semiofficial", noting that "almost all the voices in China pressing the Okinawa issue are affiliated in some way with the government."[39] The Japanese stance is that there is no territorial issue that needs to be resolved.[40] It has stated the following points as claim for the islands and counter-argument against China\'s claim. After the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government surveyed the islands in 1885, which found that the islands were terra nullius and that there was no evidence to suggest that they had ever been under Chinese control.[43] At the time of this survey, however, Yamagata Aritomo, the minister of interior of the Meji government, took a cautious approach and put off the request to incorporate the islands. The Government of Japan made a Cabinet Decision on January 14, 1895, to erect markers on the islands to formally incorporate the Senkaku Islands into the territory of Japan through the surveys conducted by the Government of Japan, it was confirmed that the Senkaku Islands had been not only uninhabited but also showed no trace of having been under the control of the Qing Dynasty of China.[13][45] Japan claims that neither China nor Ryukyu had recognized sovereignty over the uninhabited islands. Therefore, they claim that Chinese documents only prove that Kumejima, the first inhabited island reached by the Chinese, belonged to Okinawa. Kentaro Serita ( ) of Kobe University points out that the official history book of the Ming Dynasty compiled during the Qing Dynasty, called the History of Ming (), describes Taiwan in its "Biographies of Foreign Countries" () section. Thus, China did not control the Senkaku Islands or Taiwan during the Ming Dynasty.[46][unreliable source?] A record in August 1617 of Ming Shilu, the annals of Ming dynasty emperors, shows that China did not control the Senkaku Islands. According to the record, the head of the Chinese coast guard[47] mentioned the names of islands, including one on the eastern edge of the Dongyin, Lienchiang, about 40 kilometers off the Chinese mainland, that was controlled by the Ming[48] and said the ocean beyond the islands was free for China and any other nation to navigate.[49] The Senkaku Islands are about 330 kilometers from the Chinese coast. This contradicts Beijing\'s claim that China have controlled Senkaku Islands since the Ming dynasty about 600 years ago and underlines Japan\'s position that they are an inherent part of this country\'s territory. An expert in international law, says "We know the Ming had effective control only of the coastal area from other historical sources. What is remarkable about this finding is that a Chinese official made a clear statement along these lines to a Japanese envoy. This proves the Senkaku Islands were not controlled by the Ming."[50][51] After a number of Chinese were rescued from a shipwreck in 1920, an official letter authored by the Chinese Consul Feng Mien (/) in Nagasaki on behalf of the Republic of China () on 20 May 1921, made reference to "Senkaku Islands, Yaeyama District, Okinawa Prefecture, the Empire of Japan". The letter is on exhibition at Yaeyama museum.[52] The People\'s Daily, a daily newspaper, which is the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), referred to the Senkaku Islands by the Japanese name "Senkaku Shot" and described the islands were a part of (then) U.S.-occupied Ryukyu Islands. The article published on January 8, 1953 titled "Battle of people in the Ryukyu Islands against the U.S. occupation"[53] wrote "The Ryukyu Islands lie scattered on the sea between the Northeast of Taiwan of China and the Southwest of Kyushu, Japan. They consist of 7 groups of islands; the Senkaku Islands, the Sakishima Islands, the Daito Islands, the Okinawa Islands, the Oshima Islands, the Tokara Islands and the Osumi Islands."[54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61] A Chinese diplomatic draft written by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of PRC on May 15, 1950 referred to the Senkaku Islands by the Japanese name "Senkaku shot" and "Sent Shosho" and indicated Chinese recognition of the islands as part of the Ryukyu Islands. The 10-page documentp. 1p. 4p. 5p. 6 (archived at p. 1p. 4p. 5p. 6) titled "Draft outline on issues and arguments on parts concerning territories in the peace treaty with Japan"[62] says the Ryukyus "consist of three parts--northern, central, and southern. The central part comprises the Okinawa Islands, whereas the southern part comprises the Miyako Islands and the Yaeyama Islands (Sent Shosho)."[63] The parentheses appear in the original. It also says "It should be studied whether the Senkaku Islands should be incorporated into Taiwan due to an extremely close distance."[64] suggesting the Chinese government did not consider the islands part of Taiwan. The passages leave no doubt that Beijing regarded the Senkaku Islands as part of the Ryukyu Islands as of 1950.[65][66] There are many official maps published by both Chinas after 1945 that support they did not recognize their sovereignty over the islands and they recognized the islands as Japanese territory. PRC has been cracking down on erroneous maps in both print and digital forms and government agencies have handled 1,800 cases involving map irregularities and confiscated 750,000 maps since 2005. The National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation said "as China is involved in several disputes with neighboring countries, it is vital to raise public awareness of the country\'s due territory." [67] During a private visit 9 years after stepping down from office, former President of Republic of China, Lee Teng-hui, once said that the islands are part of Okinawa.[75] On December 25, 1953, U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus Proclamation 27 (USCAR 27) set geographical boundaries of the Ryukyu Islands that included the Senkaku Islands. Moreover, during U.S. administration of the islands, the U.S. Navy built firing ranges on them and paid annual rent of $11,000 to Jinji Koga, son of the first Japanese settler of the islands.[76] During the San Francisco Peace Treaty discussions, John Foster Dulles, chief U.S. delegate to the peace conference, set forth the concept that Japan had "residual sovereignty" over the Ryukyu Islands. According to an official analysis prepared by the U.S. Army, "residual Sovereignty" meant that "the United States will not transfer its sovereign powers over the Ryukyu Islands to any nation other than Japan." In June 1957, President Eisenhower confirmed this at the U.S.-Japan summit meeting, telling Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi that "residual sovereignty" over the Ryukyus meant that "the United States would exercise its rights for a period and that the sovereignty would then return to Japan." In March 1962, President Kennedy stated in an Executive Order for the Ryukyus that "I recognize the Ryukyus to be a part of the Japanese homeland and look forward to the day when the security interests of the Free World will permit their restoration to full Japanese sovereignty." Since there was no U.S. action to separate the Senkaku Islands from the Ryukyu, these applications of residual sovereignty appeared to include the Senkaku Islands.[76] In May 1971, A report compiled by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said "The Japanese claim to sovereignty over the Senkakus is strong, and the burden of proof of ownership would seem to fall on the Chinese". The CIA also said in related documents that any dispute between Japan, China and Taiwan over the islands would not have arisen, had it not been for the discovery around 1968 of potential oil reserves on the nearby continental shelf.[77] On June 7, 1971, President Richard Nixon confirmed Japan\'s "residual sovereignty" over the Senkaku Islands just before a deal to return Okinawa Prefecture to Japan in a conversation with his national security adviser Henry Kissinger. Kissinger also told Nixon that "these (Senkaku) islands stayed with Okinawa" when Japan returned Taiwan to China after the end of World War II in 1945.[78] The Nixon Administration removed the Senkakus from its inclusion in the concept of Japanese "residual sovereignty" in presenting the Okinawa Reversion Treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. On October 20, 1971, Secretary of State William Rogers sent a letter to U.S Congress. In his letter, Acting Assistant Legal Adviser Robert Starr stated "The United States believes that a return of administrative rights over those islands to Japan, from which the rights were received, can in no way prejudice any underlying claims. The United States cannot add to the legal rights Japan possessed before it transferred administration of the islands to us, nor can the United States, by giving back what it received, diminish the rights of other claimants... The United States has made no claim to the Senkaku Islands and considers that any conflicting claims to the islands are a matter for resolution by the parties concerned."[79] Several experts have attributed this Nixon Administration policy shift as having been influenced by White House overtures to China during 1971-1972, culminating in the Nixon visit to China.[76] The United States Department of State has stated that it does not take an official position on who owns the islands. Top US government officials, however, have declared in 2004, 2010, and September 2012, that as Japan maintains effective administrative control on the islands, the islands fall under the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan which requires the US to assist Japan in defending the islands if anyone, including China, attacks or attempts to occupy or control them.[80] On November 29, 2012, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved an amendment to National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 stating the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands fall under the scope of a Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and Washington would defend Japan in the event of armed attacks.[81][82] In May 2013, U.S. Department of Defense criticized the Chinese territorial claim in a report called "Military and Security Developments Involving the Peoples Republic of China 2013".[83] On 10 June 2013, United Sates Senate proposed a resolution condemning China\'s action over the Senkaku Islands. The Resolution titled "SENATE RESOLUTION 167--REAFFIRMING THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE PEACEFUL RESOLUTION OF TERRITORIAL, SOVEREIGNTY, AND JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC MARITIME DOMAINS", referring to the recent Chinese provocations near the Senkaku Islands, is asking the US Senate to condemn "the use of coercion, threats, or force by naval, maritime security, or fishing vessels and military or civilian aircraft in the South China Sea and the East China Sea to assert disputed maritime or territorial claims or alter the status quo." [84][85] When PRC-Japan diplomatic relations were established in 1972, both nations found reasons to set aside this territorial dispute.[86] According to negotiator Deng Xiaoping, "It does not matter if this question is shelved for some time, say, 10 years. Our generation is not wise enough to find common language on this question. Our next generation will certainly be wiser. They will certainly find a solution acceptable to all."[87] In 1969, the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) identified potential oil and gas reserves in the vicinity of the Senkaku Islands. During subsequent decades, several rounds of bilateral talks considered joint-development of sub-seabed resources in disputed territorial waters. Such efforts to develop a cooperative strategy were unsuccessful.[88] In 2008, a preliminary agreement on joint development of resources was reached but the agreement only includes the area far from these islands.[89] In 2009 a hotline was agreed to (and in 2010 a military-to-military hotline), neither of which have been implemented.[90] Explanations of the manifold causes of the intensified conflict involving the Senkaku Islands vary.[91][92] For example, some use the term "territorial dispute"; however, the Japanese government has consistently rejected this framing since the early 1970s.[93] An analysis of incidents and issues require distinguishing between disputes which are primarily over territory and those which merely have a territorial component.[94] The media of various nations are closely monitoring developments[97] and attempting to explain the causes of the crisis, e.g., The historical record is a backdrop for each new incident in the unfolding chronology of these islands.[103][104] While Taiwan and China first publicly claimed the islands in 1971 (in February[105] and December,[32][106] respectively), there were no major incidents between the three states regarding the islands until the 1990s. Since 2004, however, several events, including naval encounters, scrambled fighter jets, diplomatic efforts, and massive public protests, have heightened the dispute. In 1996 the Hong Kong based activist David Chan Yuk-cheung drowned while attempting to swim to one of the islands. Since 2006, vessels from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have entered waters that Japan claims as part of its exclusive economic zone connected with the islands on a number of occasions. In some cases, the incursions have been carried out by Chinese and Taiwanese protesters, such as in 2006 when a group of activists from the Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands approached the islands; the group was stopped by the Japanese Coast Guard prior to landing.[107] In June 2008 activists from Taiwan, accompanied by Chinese Coast Guard vessels, approached within 0.4 nautical miles (740m) of the main island, from which position they circumnavigated the island in an assertion of sovereignty of the islands.[108] In 2011, a fishing boat carrying some activists navigated to within 23 nautical miles of the islands. Japan sent coast guard vessels to block the ship and a helicopter to monitor its actions, subsequent to which the Coast Guard Agency Keelung office of Taiwan sent five patrol vessels. After a short standoff between the two groups of vessels, the Taiwanese fleet returned to their own territory.[109][110] In July 2012, Coastguard vessels from Taiwan and Japan collided while the Taiwanese vessel was escorting activists to the area.[111] In August 2012, activists from Hong Kong were able to swim ashore after their boat was stopped by the Japan Coast Guard. The activists were detained and then deported two days later.[112] In January 2013, a boat carrying activists from Taiwan was intercepted by Japanese patrols and diverted from an attempted landing on the islands through the use of water cannons.[113] In addition, a number of incidents have occurred due to the presence of Chinese or Taiwanese fishing vessels in sea zones claimed by Japan. In some cases, these incidents have resulted in a collision between boats. The first major event occurred in 2008, when a Taiwanese fishing boat and a Japanese patrol vessel collided. The passengers were released, but the captain was detained for three days.[114] Later in June, after releasing video taken by the Taiwanese boat, Japan apologized for the incident[115] and agreed to pay NT$10 million (US$311,000) as compensation to the owner of the boat.[116] On 7 September 2010, a Chinese fishing trawler collided with two Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats in disputed waters near the islands. The collisions occurred after the Japanese Coast Guard ordered the trawler to leave the area. After the collisions, Japanese sailors boarded the Chinese vessel and arrested the captain Zhan Qixiong.[117] Japan held the captain until 24 September.[118] Each country blamed the other for the collision.[40] While Japanese government vessels regularly patrol the ocean surrounding the islands, Japanese civilians have also entered the area. In July 2010, nine Japanese boats fished in the area. A spokesman from Ganbare Nippon, which owned one of the vessels, stated it was done specifically to assert Japanese sovereignty over the islands.[119] In August 2012, Ganbare Nippon organized a group of four vessels carrying Japanese activists travelling to the islands,[120] carrying about 150 Japanese activists.[121] The Japanese government denied the groups the right to land, after which a number swam to shore and raised a Japanese flag.[122] On some occasions, ships and planes from various Chinese and Taiwanese government and military agencies have entered the disputed area. In addition to the cases where they escorted fishing and activist vessels as described above, there have been other incursions. In an eight month period in 2012, over forty maritime incursions and 160 aerial incursions occurred.[123] For example, in July 2012, Three Chinese patrol vessels entered the disputed waters around the islands.[124] On December 13, 2012, a Chinese government aircraft entered Japanese-controlled airspace for the first time since records began in 1958,[125] following months of incursions by Chinese surface vessels.[126] The Japan Air Self-Defense Force scrambled eight F-15 fighters and an airborne early warning aircraft in response to the Chinese flight. The Japanese government made a formal diplomatic protest to China.[127] The most direct confrontation to date between the countries\' official vessels occurred in September 2012. Seventy five Taiwanese fishing vessels were escorted by ten Taiwanese Coast Guard vessels to the area, and the Taiwanese Coast Guard ships clashed with Japanese Coast Guard ships. Both sides fired water cannons at each other and used LED lights and loudspeakers to announce their respective claims to the islands.[128] Military escalation continued in 2013. The two sides sent fighter airplanes to monitor ships and other planes in the area.[129] In February, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera revealed that a Chinese frigate had locked weapons-targeting radar onto a Japanese destroyer and helicopter on two occasions in January.[130] The Chinese Jiangwei II class frigate and the Japanese destroyer were three kilometers apart, and the crew of the latter went to battle stations.[131] The Chinese state media responded that their frigates had been engaged in routine training at the time.[132] In late February 2013, U.S. intelligence detected China moving road-mobile ballistic missiles closer to the coast near the disputed islands, this included DF-16s.[133] In May 2013, a warship flotilla from North Sea Fleet deployed from Qingdao for training exercises western North Pacific Ocean.[134] The various governments have lodged protests and criticisms of each other in response to the unfolding situation in and around the islands. For example, the Taiwanese government recalled its highest representative to Japan in the wake of the 2008 collision.[135] Similarly, the Chinese government protested the 2012 Ganbare Nippon incident.[136] The 2010 collision incident resulted in a significant increase in tensions between the two countries, both during the event as they argued over the released on the fishing boat crew, and after, as both said they would seek compensation from the other for damages.[137] There have been a number of public protests in all three countries, often triggered by the specific incidents noted above. The first major set of protests revolved around the 2010 boat collision, with protests being held in Japan, China, and Taiwan. In 2012, major protests began in August 2012 after reports that the Japanese government was considering purchasing the islands. The protests continued after the formal purchase into the middle of September. At the height of the protests, there were demonstrations in as many as 85 Chinese cities,[138] along with Hong Kong[139] and the United States.[140] In many cases, these protests included anti-Japanese violence, vandalism, and arson.[141][142][143]'

aS'In the United Kingdom to identify individual aircraft, all military aircraft are allocated and display a unique serial number. A unified serial number system, maintained by the Air Ministry (AM), and its successor the Ministry of Defence (MoD), is used for aircraft operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and Army Air Corps (AAC). Military aircraft operated by government agencies and civilian contractors (for example QinetiQ) are also assigned serials from this system. When the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed in 1912 aircraft were identified by a letter/number system related to the manufacturer. The prefix "A" was allocated to balloons of No.1 Company, Air Battalion, Royal Engineers, the prefix "B" to aeroplanes of No.2 Company, and the prefix "F" to aeroplanes of the Central Flying School.[1] The Naval Wing used the prefix "H" for seaplanes ("Hydroaeroplanes" as they were then known), "M" for monoplanes, and "T" for aeroplanes with engines mounted in tractor configuration.[1] Before the end of the first year a unified serial number system was introduced for both Army and Naval aircraft. The serials are allocated when the contract is placed with the manufacturer or supplier. In an RAF or FAA pilot\'s personal, service log book, the serial number of any aircraft flown, along with any other particulars, such as aircraft type, flight time, purpose of flight, etc., is entered by the pilot after every flight, thus giving a complete record of the pilot\'s flying activities and which individual aircraft have been flown. This first series ran from 1 to 10000 with blocks allocated to each service. The first serial was allocated to a Short S.34 for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), with the number 10000 going to a Blackburn-built B.E.2c aircraft in 1916.[2] By 1916 the first sequence had reached 10000 (allocated to a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2, built by Blackburn Aircraft) and it was decided to start an alpha-numeric system from A1 (allocated to a Royal Aircraft Factory BE.2d) to A9999 then starting again at B1. The letters A, B, C, D, E, F, H, and J were allocated to the Royal Flying Corps and N1 to N9999 and S1 to S9999 to the Royal Naval Air Service. When the sequence reached the prefix K it was decided to start at K1000 for all subsequent letters instead of K1. Although the N and S series had earlier been used by RNAS aircraft, the sequence N1000 to N9999 was again used by the Air Ministry for both RAF and RN aircraft. The \'Naval\' S sequence had reached only S1865, a Fairey IIIF, but when R9999 was reached in 1939, the next serial allocations did not run on from that point, but instead commenced at T1000. From 1937 not all aircraft serials were allocated, in order to hide the true number of aircraft in production and service. Gaps in the serial number sequence were sometimes referred to as "blackout blocks".[3] The first example of this practice was an early 1937 order for 200 Avro Manchester bombers which were allotted the serials L7276-7325, L7373-7402, L7415-7434, L7453-7497, L7515-7549 and L7565-7584, covering a range of 309 possible serial numbers, and thus possibly leading an enemy to over-estimate British military aircraft strength. By 1940 the serial Z9978 had been allocated to a Bristol Blenheim and it was decided to restart the sequence with a two-letter prefix, starting at AA100. This sequence is still in use today. Until the 1990s this 2-letter, 3-numeral serial number sequence, had numbers in the range 100 to 999. An exception to this rule was Douglas Skyraider AEW1 which received the UK serial WT097, which incorporated the last 3 digits of its US Navy Bureau Number 124097. Recently, past unassigned serials, including those having numerals 001-099, have been assigned. Some letters have not been used to avoid confusion: C confusion with G, I confusion with 1, O and Q confusion with 0, U confusion with V and Y confusion with X. During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had "/G" suffix added to the end of the serial, [1] the "G" signifying "Guard", denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, for example LZ548/G, the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or ML926/G, a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. As of 2009, serial allocations have reached the ZKnnn range. However, in recent years, serials have increasingly been allocated out-of-sequence. For example the first RAF C-17 Globemaster was given the serial ZZ171 in 2001, and a batch of Britten-Norman Defenders for the AAC were given serials in the ZGnnn range in 2003 (the last ZG serial being allocated more than 14 years previously). Also, some recent serials allocations have had a numeric part in the previously-unused 001 to 099 range. Distinct serial numbering systems are used to identify non-flying airframes used for ground training. The RAF have used a numeric sequence with an \'M\' suffix sometimes referred to as the \'Maintenance\' series.[3] Known allocations, made between 1921 and 2000, ranged from 540M to 9344M, when this sequence was terminated. The main series of single letter serials did not use \'M\' to avoid confusion with the suffix \'M\'. The Fleet Air Arm use an \'A\'-prefixed sequence (e.g. A2606) and the Army Air Corps issue \'TAD\' numbers to their instructional airframes (e.g. TAD015). The serial numbers are normally carried in up to four places on each aircraft, on either side of the aircraft on a vertical surface and on the underside of each wing. The underwing serials have not been displayed since the 1960s. The serial on each side is usually on the rear fuselage, but this can vary depending on the aircraft type, for instance the delta winged Gloster Javelin had the serial on the forward engine nacelle, and the Avro Vulcan had the serial on the fin. Helicopters have only carried serials on each side, either on the tailboom or rear fuselage.'

aS"Castra Praetoria were the ancient barracks (castra) of the Praetorian Guard of Imperial Rome. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, the barracks were built in 23 AD by Lucius Aelius Sejanus, the praetorian prefect serving under the emperor Tiberius, in an effort to consolidate the several divisions of the guards. The barracks were erected just outside the city of Rome and surrounded by solid masonry walls, measuring a total of 440 x 380 meters (1443 x 1246ft). Three of the four sides of the walls were later incorporated in the Aurelian Walls, and parts of them are clearly visible today. The adjacent city district Castro Pretorio is named after the barracks. The Castra Praetoria was the site of the murder of the Emperor Elagabalus by the Praetorian Guard in 222 AD. The Castra Praetoria was destroyed by Constantine I, who also disbanded the Praetorian Guard upon his conquest of Italy while Maxentius ruled as the Western Roman Emperor.[1] Their last stand was at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312, and after Constantine's victory he officially disbanded the Praetorian, sending them out to different corners of the empire.

When the club joined the football association of Gelderland, the club had to change its name, because there was another club called Steeds Voorwaarts. The name was changed to AGOVV, or Apeldoornse Geheel Onthouders Voetbalvereniging, which means Apeldoorn football club for teetotallers. The meaning of the abbreviation has since been altered. AGOVV has become Alleen Gezamenlijk Oefenen Voert Verder [len .za.m(n).lk u.f.n(n) vurt fr.dr] (Only Practising Together Brings us Further). AGOVV became a professional (league) club in 1954, and returned to the amateur ranks in 1971 due to financial problems. On 1 July 2003, AGOVV returned to the Dutch professional league, when it was re-admitted to the Eerste Divisie. In the 2003/2004 season, forward Klaas-Jan Huntelaar became top scorer of the Eerste Divisie with 26 goals.

aS"Sturgeons House is a Grade II listed country estate located west of the small village of Writtle in Essex, England.[1] At its height, the estate comprised around 500 acres (2,000,000m2). However, it currently holds only around 6 acres (24,000m2) of ground. The house is currently under renovation, including an extension to the rear of the property. The house, along with the surrounding barns, is an example of an early model farm. There has been human settlement at the site since 1280, when William Turgis established a farm there. The name 'Sturgeons' derived from the Turgis family-name. The location was chosen upon the discovery of a natural spring in the area. The current house was built in the 1830s in the Georgian style. It was built for William Addy, who spent the greater part of his fortune on the project. Due to ill health, he moved from the property soon after it was finished. The Blythe family then came to own the house and surrounding farmland for almost a hundred years. In the mid 19th century, Sturgeons farm became a leading model farm. The farm's owners researched and demonstrated improvements in agricultural techniques, efficiency, and building layout. Education, and commitment to improving welfare standards of workers were also aspects of the ideal farm movement. The farm buildings were designed to be beautiful as well as utilitarian - inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment. In the 1930s, Sturgeons farm (including Sturgeons House) was acquired by Writtle College. In recent times, the house has been the home of the Principal of Writtle College. In 2007 the college sold the property as part of its restructuring and modernisation programme.[2] Sturgeons Farm is still retained by the college. The area is rich in local wildlife. There are small badger and fox populations, along with Reeves's muntjac; moorhens; pheasants; hares and rabbits. There are also numerous oak, yew and willow trees. Excavation work in fields to the rear of the house has resulted in Roman pottery and metalware being discovered. Speculation that a Roman villa once existed on the site has yet to be verified."

aS"CKPC is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts at 1380 kHz in Brantford, Ontario. Owned and operated by Evanov Communications, the station airs a country music format branded as AM 1380. CKPC went on the air in 1923. Its original city of license was Preston, Ontario (now part of the city of Cambridge, Ontario), but was moved to Brantford shortly after. The station first started out as an amateur radio station, but the founder (Wallace Russ) quickly applied for a broadcast license after a few trial broadcasts. His license was granted, and he started broadcasting from his home in Preston at a power of just 5 watts. After Russ sold the station to his friend Cyrus Dolph, he still remained active with the station, and watched it grow throughout its early years. Its power would later increase to 25 watts in 1927, doubling in power and moving to 1010kHz at 50 watts in 1930, and to 880kHz. The station's main content was local news, and local artists and talents from Kitchener, Hamilton, and Brantford. On December 29, 1927, the station officially moved to the Arcade Building in downtown Brantford, under the supervision of his daughter, Florence Dolph Buchanan, and her husband (and station manager) J.D. Buchanan. Its transmitter was located in the Six Nations Reserve at the time. In 1934, the station moved again on the AM dial, to 930kHz. Six years later, Florence Buchanan became both owner and manager of CKPC-AM, becoming the first woman in Canada to own and/or operate a radio station. The next year, the station moved to its present frequency, 1380kHz. The station grew significantly through the postwar years, and moved to bigger facilities in Brantford. On June 1, 2004 CKPC-AM switched from an adult contemporary format to an oldies one. On June 24, 2010 at noon the station switched to playing Country Music hits from the 1960s to the present. "

aS"The red pulp of the spleen is composed of connective tissue known as the cords of Billroth and many splenic sinuses that are engorged with blood, giving it a red color.[1][2] Its primary function is to filter the blood of antigens, microorganisms, and defective or worn-out red blood cells.[3] The spleen is made of red pulp and white pulp, separated by the marginal zone; 76-79% of a normal spleen is red pulp.[4] Unlike white pulp, which mainly contains lymphocytes such as T cells, red pulp is made up of several different types of blood cells, including platelets, granulocytes, red blood cells, and plasma.[1] The splenic sinuses of the spleen, also known as sinusoids, are wide vessels that drain into trabecular veins. Gaps in the endothelium lining the sinusoids mechanically filter blood cells as they enter the spleen. Worn-out or abnormal red cells attempting to squeeze through the narrow intercellular spaces become badly damaged, and are subsequently devoured by macrophages in the red pulp.[5] In addition to aged red blood cells, the sinusoids also filter out particles that could clutter up the bloodstream, such as nuclear remnants or denatured hemoglobin. Red pulp consists of a dense network of fine reticular fiber, continuous with those of the splenic trabeculae, to which are applied flat, branching cells. The meshes of the reticulum are filled with blood: In lymphoid leukemia, the white pulp of the spleen hypertrophies and the red pulp shrinks.[4] In some cases the white pulp can swell to 50% of the total volume of the spleen.[6] In myeloid leukemia, the white pulp atrophies and the red pulp expands.[4] This article incorporates text from a public domain edition of Gray's Anatomy.

aS"The New Zealand ADK class diesel multiple unit (DMU) are a class of urban passenger units operating on Auckland's suburban rail network. Each is coupled to an ADB class trailer. Originally built for Western Australian Government Railways in the late 1960s, the units were introduced to Auckland's network in 1993, and are due to be withdrawn from service following the completion of electrification of Auckland's network. The units are owned by Auckland Transport, and operated by Veolia. These units were built for the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) in 19671968. The ADK driving units were manufactured by Commonwealth Engineering, and the ADB trailer units were manufactured at the WAGR's Midland Railway Workshops. They were purchased along with the newer ADL/ADC class units by New Zealand Rail Limited in 1993 to replace the 56-foot carriage suburban carriage trains then used in Auckland. Later that year, they were sold by New Zealand Rail to the Auckland Regional Council (ARC). The units were credited with an increase in patronage in the Auckland system, but have a number of reliability problems due to their age.[2] In 2004 the ARC funded the upgrade of the entire class, which included refurbishment of the interiors of the units and the painting of the exterior in the new MAXX colour scheme. The upgrade also include mechanical improvements which would extend the useful life of these units by 10 years. After the upgrades were completed, ADK/ADB trains ran as permanent 4-car sets rather than the 2-car sets they ran as previously.[3] All ADKs are refurbished, except ADB 773 (in use at a paintball arena) and ADK 689 (which never came to New Zealand). All ADK units have been scheduled to be decommissioned by the end of 2015[4] at the end of the Auckland rail electrification project.

aS'In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as module theory, a ring R is called hereditary if all submodules of projective modules over R are again projective. If this is required only for finitely generated submodules, it is called semihereditary. For a noncommutative ring R, the terms left hereditary and left semihereditary and their right hand versions are used to distinguish the property on a single side of the ring. To be left (semi-)hereditary, all (finitely generated) submodules of projective left R-modules must be projective, and to be right (semi-)hereditary all (finitely generated) submodules of projective right submodules must be projective. It is possible for a ring to be left (semi-)hereditary but not right (semi-)hereditary, and vice versa. '

aS'Afrocentrism (also Afrocentricity) is a cultural ideology, worldview mostly limited to the United States and is dedicated to the history of Black people. It is a response to global (Eurocentric/Orientalist) racist attitudes about African people and their historical contributions and revisits their history with an African cultural and ideological focus. Afrocentricity deals primarily with self-determination and African agency and is[1] a Pan-African ideology in culture, philosophy, and history.[2] Afrocentrism can be seen as an African-American inspired ideology that manifests an affirmation of themselves in a Eurocentric-dominated society, commonly by conceptualizing a glorified heritage in terms of distinctly African, foreign origins (where foreign is anything not indigenous to Sub-Saharan Africa). It often denies or minimizes European cultural influences while accenting historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on African-American culture and the history of Africa, and involves an African Diaspora version of an African-centered view of history and culture to portray the achievements and development of Africans who have been marginalized by other races of people (usually Arabs and whites). What is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct academic ideology, reached its peak in the 80\'s and 90\'s.[3] Today it is primarily associated with its advocate Molefi Asante. Proponents of Afrocentrism support the claim that the contributions of various African people have been downplayed or discredited as part of the legacy of colonialism and slavery\'s pathology of "writing Africans out of history"[4][5][6] Critics of Afrocentricity accuse it of pseudo-history, reactionary,[7] and therapy.[8] The term "Afrocentrism" dates to 1961 or 1962.[citation needed] The adjective "Afrocentric" appears in a typescript proposal for an entry in Encyclopedia Africana, possibly due to W. E. B. Du Bois.[9] The abstract noun "Afrocentricity" dates to the 1970s,[10] and was popularized by Molefi Asante\'s Afrocentricity: The Theory of Social Change (1980). Afrocentrism has its origins in the work of African and African diaspora intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of slavery and the decline of colonialism. Following the American Civil War, African Americans in the South gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation.[11] American and African intellectuals looked to the African past for a re-evaluation of what its civilizations had achieved and what they meant for contemporary people.[12][13] The combination of the European centuries gives us about four to five hundred years of solid European domination of intellectual concepts and philosophical ideas. Africa and Asia were subsumed under various headings of the European hierarchy. If a war between the European powers occurred it was called a World War and the Asians and Africans found their way on the side of one European power or the other.There was this sense of assertiveness about European culture that advanced with Europes trade, religious, and military forces.[14]  Dr. Molefi Asante, De-Westernizing Communication: Strategies for Neutralizing Cultural Myths As an ideology and political movement, Afrocentrism had its beginnings in activism among black intellectuals, political figures, and historians in the context of the US American civil rights movement.[15] According to U.S. professor Victor Oguejiofor Okafor, concepts of Afrocentricity lie at the core of disciplines such as African American studies.[16] But Wilson J. Moses claims that Afrocentrism roots are not exclusively African: Despite the fulminations of ethno-chauvinists and other prejudiced persons, it remains a fact that the contributions of white scholars, like Boas, Malinowski, and Herskovits, were fundamental to that complex of ideas that we designate to days as Afrocentrism...Students of African and African American history have long appreciated the irony that much of what we now call Afrocentrism was developed during the 1930s by the Jewish American scholar Melville Herskovits[17]  Wilson J. Moses, Historical Sketches of Afrocentrism In 1987, Martin Bernal published his Black Athena, in which he claims ancient Greece was colonized by northern invaders mixing with a colony established by Phoenicia (modern Lebanon). A major theme of the work is the alleged denial by Western academia of the African and (western) Asiatic influence on ancient Greek culture. Afrocentrics have been accused of regularly denying, mitigating, or outright ignoring, or reinterprets certain negative aspects of Africans; most notably the selling of African slaves by other Africans to the Europeans, the Rwandan Genocide, and the ongoing struggles against rape and violence in many African nations today, generally placing blame for these atrocities directly or indirectly on the Europeans and Arabs, and denying any serious culpability on part of Africans.[18] Some observe that this trend is not unique to Afrocentrics but many national or ethnocentric-based ideologies.[18][19] In 2000, Molefi Kete Asante, chair of the Department of African American Studies at Temple University gave a lecture at the University of Liverpool entitled "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium,"[20] in which he presented many of his ideas: Asante also stated: However, Wilson J. Moses, says "his second book, The Afrocentric Idea (1987), was a creative and in some respects brilliant but rambling theoretical work, much influenced by the revolution in "critical theory" that occurred in American intellectual life during the late 1970s and early 1980s."[3] Some also assert that the definition of Afrocentricity has never sat still long enough to be properly described and accurately critiqued.[21] Afrocentricity and African-Centered share similar roots, and objectives, but are very different because African-centered only refers to the worldview inherent in African people (African and centered); which is natural and evident in all cultures. It therefore deals with cultural pedagogy, but is different from Afrocentrism which is an ideology, not only a worldview.[22] The premise behind African-Centered Education is the notion that human beings can be subjugated and made servile by limiting their consciousness of themselves and by imposing certain selective aspects of alien knowledge on them.[23] The term "mis-education" was coined by Dr. Carter G. Woodson to describe the process of systematically depriving African Americans of their knowledge of self. Dr. Woodson believed that mis-education was the root of the problems of the masses of the African-American community and that if the masses of the African American-community had been given the correct knowledge and education from the beginning, they would not be in the situation that they find themselves in today. The problem concerning formal education is seen by Afrocentrists to be that African-American students are taught to perceive the world through the eyes of another culture, and unconsciously learn to see themselves as an insignificant part of their world. An Afrocentric education does not wish to isolate Africans from a Eurocentric education system. It wishes to assert the autonomy of Africans and encompass the cultural uniqueness of all learners. A school based on African values, eliminates the patterns of rejection and alienation that engulf so many African-American school children, especially males. The movement for African-centered education is based on the assumption that a school immersed in African traditions, rituals, values, and symbols will provide a learning environment that is more congruent with the lifestyles and values of African-American families. People who disagree with this point of view note the achievements of many African Americans educated according to contemporary United States and European standards, such as W. E. B. Du Bois and other intellectuals of the early 20th century, as well as Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and others of the later 20th and 21st century. The black church in the United States developed out of the creolization of African spirituality and European-American Christianity; early members of the churches made certain stories their own. During the antebellum years, the idea of deliverance out of slavery, as in the story of Exodus, was especially important. After Reconstruction and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with Jesus, and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.[citation needed] Twentieth-century "Africentric approaches" to Christian theology and preaching have been more deliberate. Writers and thinkers emphasize "Black presence" in the Christian Bible, including the idea of a "Black Jesus".[24] In 1966 Maulana Karenga of the US Organization created Kwanzaa as the first specifically African American holiday.[25][26] Karenga said his goal was to "give Blacks an alternative to the existing holiday and give Blacks an opportunity to celebrate themselves and history, rather than simply imitate the practice of the dominant society."[27]  Afrocentricity contends that race exists primarily as a social and political construct  that is, that race is important because of its cultural rather than its biological significance.[dubious  discuss][citation needed] Many Afrocentrists seek to challenge concepts such as white privilege, color-blind perspectives, and race-neutral pedagogies. There are strong ties between Afrocentricity and Critical race theory.[28] Afrocentrists hold that Africans exhibit a range of types and physical characteristics, and that such elements as wavy hair or aquiline facial features are part of a continuum of African types that do not depend on admixture with Caucasian groups. They cite work by Hiernaux[29] and Hassan[30] that they believe demonstrates that populations could vary based on micro-evolutionary principles (climate adaptation, drift, selection), and that such variations existed in both living and fossil Africans.[31] Afrocentrists have condemned what they consider to be attempts at dividing African peoples into racial clusters as new versions of what they deem older, discredited theories, such as the "Hamitic Hypothesis" and the Dynastic Race Theory. These theories, they contend, attempted to identify certain African ethnicities, such as Nubians, Ethiopians and Somalis, as "Caucasoid" groups that entered Africa to bring civilization to the natives. They believe that Western academics have traditionally limited the peoples they defined as "Black" Africans to those south of the Sahara, but used broader "Caucasoid" or related categories to classify peoples of Egypt or North Africa. Afrocentrists also believe strongly in the work of certain anthropologists who have suggested that there is little evidence to support that the North African populations are closely related to "Caucasoids" of Europe and western Asia.[29] In 1964 Afrocentric scholar Cheikh Anta Diop expressed a belief in such a double standard: French historian Jean Vercoutter has claimed that archaeological workers routinely classified Negroid remains as Mediterranean, even though they found such remains in substantial numbers with ancient artefacts.[33] Some Afrocentrists have adopted a pan-Africanist perspective that people of color are all "African people" or "diasporic Africans," citing physical characteristics they exhibit in common with Black Africans. Afrocentric scholar Runoko Rashidi writes that they are all part of the "global African community." Some Afrocentric writers include in the African diaspora the Dravidians of India, "Negritos" of Southeast Asia (Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia); and the aboriginal peoples of Australia and Melanesia. A few Afrocentrists claim that the Olmecs of Mexico were a hybrid society of Native American peoples and Africans. Mainstream historians of Mesoamerica overwhelmingly reject that view with detailed rebuttals.[34] Some critics of Afrocentrism note that the Afrocentric designation of Southeast Asians and Melanesians as "African diaspora" is made without reference to the self-identities of the peoples in question. They may not identify themselves as African, as they have tens of thousands of years of history in the places where they live, like people of Papa New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.[35] In the largest sense, all humans are descended from ancestors in Africa but cultures and civilizations have aisen around the world that distinguish themselves as separate. Anthropologists note that modern man is the product of evolution of populations in many different areas of the globe after the migrations out of Africa.[citation needed] In the 1970s, Ivan van Sertima advanced the theory that the complex civilizations of the Americas were the result of trans-oceanic influence from the Egyptians or other African civilizations. Such a claim is his primary thesis in They Came Before Columbus, published in 1978. The few hyper-diffusionist writers seek to establish that the Olmec people, who built the first highly complex civilization in Mesoamerica and are considered by some to be the mother civilization for all other civilizations of Mesoamerica, were deeply influenced by Africans. Van Sertima said that the Olmec civilization was a hybrid one of Africans and Native Americans. His theory of pre-Columbian American-African contact has since met with considerable and detailed opposition by scholars of Mesoamerica. Van Sertima has been accused of "doctoring" and twisting data to fit his conclusions, inventing evidence, and ignoring the work of respected Central and South American scholars in the advance of his own theory.[34] Several Afrocentrists have claimed that important cultural characteristics of ancient Egypt were indigenous to Africa and that these features were present in other early African civilizations[36] such as the later Kerma and the Meroitic civilizations of Nubia.[37] Scholars who have held this view include Marcus Garvey, George James, Cheikh Anta Diop, Martin Bernal, Ivan van Sertima, John Henrik Clarke, Chancellor Williams, and Molefi Kete Asante. The claim has also been made by many Afrocentric scholars that the Ancient Egyptians themselves were Black African or Africoid people and that the various invasions on Egypt resulted in the Africanity of Ancient Egypt becoming diluted, resulting in the modern diversity seen today.[38] Scholars have challenged the various assertions of Afrocentrists on the cultural and biological characteristics of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its people. At a UNESCO Symposium in the 1970s, the vast majority of the delegates repudiated the Afrocentric assertions.[39] Zahi Hawass has gone on record as saying that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and Ancient Egypt was not a Black African Civilization.[40] It should also be noted that Egyptians themselves did not refer to themselves as \'Black\' as they had no conception of \'race\'. S.O.Y. Keita, a biological anthropologist studying the controversy however, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as \'black\' or \'white\' to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients.[41] Responding to Hawass\' assertion in the press that Egyptians were not Black or that Egypt was not an African civilization, Keita claims that Hawass\' statement obscures the reality of research in the Nile valley that paints a very complex picture and that most people familiar with this research would not get up in front of a group to make such a claim so openly.[42] Recent DNA studies have results indicate these ancient individuals such as the Amarna mummies inherited some alleles that today are more frequent in populations of Africa than in other parts of the world[43] Stephen Howe summarizes the development of the "Hamitic Hypothesis" in the 19th and 20th centuries as Eurocentric. He further describes how some Afrocentric writers adopted \'their version\' of it. Howe distinguishes three clusters of controversies related to the history of Ancient Egypt. About the third cluster he says that these are "controversies that have been especially salient in relation to the United States, have interacted heavily with sensitive issues of current public policy, and involve questions both wide and fundamentally about the United States."[44] Within Afrocentrism, claims were forwarded involving the contention that African civilizations were founding influences on such distant civilizations as the American Olmec and the Chinese Xia cultures.[34][45] Yaacov Shavit, a critic of the movement, summarises its goals in the preface to his book History in Black,[46] in which he states: Other critics contend that some Afrocentric historical research is grounded in identity politics and myth rather than scholarship.[47] In The Skeptic\'s Dictionary,[48] philosophy professor Robert Todd Carroll labeled Afrocentrism "pseudohistorical". He argued that Afrocentrism\'s prime goal was to encourage black nationalism and ethnic pride in order to effectively combat the destructive consequences of cultural and universal racism.[49][50] Similarly, African-American professor Clarence E. Walker, who teaches history at the University of California, Davis, has described Afrocentrism as "a mythology that is racist, reactionary, essentially therapeutic and is eurocentrism in black face."[51] "Afrocentrism offers little more than a psychological and therapeutic feel-good-together philosophy."~ Tunde Adeleke, The Case against Afrocentrism Mary Lefkowitz, Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, has rejected George James\'s theories about Egyptian contributions to Greek civilization as being faulty scholarship. She notes that he used sources that predated the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs. He failed to acknowledge that many of his theories were overturned by the evidence of later findings. She contends that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz also pointed out that Aristotle could not have stolen his ideas from the great Library at Alexandria as James suggested, because the library was founded after Aristotle\'s death. Because of such fundamental errors of fact, Lefkowitz has criticized Afrocentrism as "an excuse to teach myth as history."[47] In 1994 the Manhattan Institute, a public policy forum, published Alternatives to Afrocentrism, a collection of highly critical essays by, among others, Lefkowitz, Gerald Early, Stanley Crouch, Wilson Moses, and Frank Yurco. Early, an African American, has been especially critical and dismisses Afrocentrism as just another North American experiment in "group therapy," a kind of "intellectual fast food".[19] In 2002 Ibrahim Sundiata noted in the American Historical Review that Cain Hope Felder, a Professor of New Testament Language and Literature at Howard University and supporter of Afrocentric ideas, has warned Afrocentrists to avoid certain pitfalls,[54] including: Nathan Glazer writes that although Afrocentricity can mean many things, the popular press has generally given most attention to its most outlandish theories.[55] Glazer agrees with many of the findings and conclusions presented in Lefkowitz\'s book Not Out of Africa. Yet he also argues that Afrocentrism often presents legitimate and relevant scholarship.[55] Similarly, Owen Alik Shahadah defends the historical need for the Afrocentric world view while also warning that "Continually viewing history through a modern racial lens distorts the historical timeline and creates academic anachronism."[56] The late Manning Marable was also a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:[8] Populist Afrocentrism was the perfect social theory for the upwardly mobile black petty bourgeoisie. It gave them a sense of ethnic superiority and cultural originality, without requiring the hard, critical study of historical realities. It provided a philosophical blueprint to avoid concrete struggle within the real world.... It was, in short, only the latest theoretical construct of a politics of racial identity, a world-view designed to discuss the world but never really to change it.  Manning Marable, Beyond Black and White: Transforming African American Politics Some Afrocentrists agree in rejecting those works which critics have characterized as examples of bad scholarship. Adisa A. Alkebulan notes that the work of Afrocentric scholars is not fully appreciated because critics use the claims of "a few non-Afrocentrists" as "an indictment against Afrocentricity."[57] In 1996 the historian August Meier critically reviewed the new work of Mary Lefkowitz on Afrocentrism as "Eurocentric". He criticized her book Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History for what he saw as her neglect of the African-American historic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. Meier believes she fails to take the African-American experiences into account, to the extent that she "fails to answer the question raised in this book\'s subtitle".[58] Maghan Keita describes the controversy over Afrocentrism as a cultural war. He believes certain "epistemologies" are warring with each other: the "epistemology of blackness" argues for the "responsibilities and potential of black peoples to function in and contribute to the progress of civilization."[59] Eugene D. Genovese, in his work The Southern Front: History and Politics in the Cultural War,[60] states that the decadence within American society is not only the consequence of modern liberalism but its actual agenda, and that the cultural elites who control American campuses mean to destroy Western civilization (p.132). Genovese attempts to demonstrate mistreatment of things and thoughts Southern by Americas cultural elite, and he links this to a concerted culture war.'

aS'The gerenuk, Litocranius walleri, also known as the Waller\'s gazelle, is a long-necked species of antelope found in dry thorn bush scrub and desert in East Africa, from Somalia, Djibouti and eastern Ethiopia through northern and eastern Kenya to northeastern Tanzania. The word gerenuk (pronounced with a hard g) comes from the Somali language, meaning "giraffe-necked". Gerenuk are sometimes also called the giraffe-necked antelope. It is the sole member of the genus Litocranius. Gerenuks have a relatively small head for their body, but their eyes and ears are proportionately large. Only the males have horns and they also have a more muscular neck than females. Both sexes have ruddy brown coats with a paler underbelly . They have short, black tipped tails. The gerenuk is easily recognisable from its distinctive long and skinny neck which can be elongated further if need be for activities like feeding off the taller brambles and undergrowth of the dessert. It also has remarkably long slender legs which is another great advantage as they can gallop away into the distance at very high speeds from any form of predator trying to attack. However, because of their extreme length of legs, they can be more liable to fracture of the leg bone. There has been numerous occasions in which the gerenuk actually snapped their long legs due to tripping and stumbling along the floor. From head to tail, the gerenuk is around 150 centimetres (59in) long. Males are a little taller than females, at 89105cm (3541in) tall, with the females typically 80100cm (3139in) tall. The male is also heavier than the female, weighing 45 kilograms (99lb), while females weigh around 30kg (66lb). Many breeders of gerenuks and zoologists have described gerenuks as being an extremely humble animal, it always helps fellow gerenuks. In ancient African Tribe tales, the gerenuk has often been crowned \'Queen of Humblness.\' Gerenuks seldom graze but browse on prickly bushes and trees, such as acacias. They can reach higher branches and twigs than other gazelles and antelope by standing erect on their rear legs and elongating their necks. They appear to favour the more tender leaves and shoots, but will also eat buds, flowers, fruit, and herbaceous plants.[2] Gerenuks do not appear to drink water; they get enough water from the plants they eat. Because of this, they can survive in very dry habitats. Gerenuks are often prey for lions, cheetahs, jackals and leopards. Gerenuk reproduce throughout the year. Females reach sexual maturity at around one year, and males reach sexual maturity at 1.5 years, although in the wild they may only be successful after acquiring a territory (perhaps 3.5 years).[2] The gestation period is about seven months. They are born one at a time, weighing about 3kg (6.6lb) at birth. Offspring were produced through artificial insemination for the first time in 2010 at White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida. Four female calves were born, and one of the four was later inseminated successfully by White Oak and SEZARC (South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction & Conservation), creating a second generation of calves born from artificial insemination.[3] Gerenuk can live 13 years or more in captivity, and at least eight years in the wild.[2]'

aS'The 1979 Cleveland Browns season was the team\'s 30th season with the National Football League. In a season which could be titled "The Birth of The Kardiac Kids" the Browns, who finished 9-7, nearly made the playoffs while involved in a number of close games. They won their first three contests, all by three points, over the New York Jets in overtime 25-22, Kansas City Chiefs 27-24 and Baltimore Colts 13-10. They lost to the Washington Redskins by four points, 13-9, midway through the season, then beat the Cincinnati Bengals by one, 28-27, the following Sunday and the Philadelphia Eagles by five, 24-19, two weeks later. The Browns proceeded to lose to the Seattle Seahawks by five points, 29-24, beat the Miami Dolphins by six, 30-24, in overtime and lose to the Pittsburgh Steelers by three, 33-30, again in OT. That was the last of the Browns three overtime games that season. Then came a virtual "blowout" -- a seven-point victory over the Houston Oilers, 14-7 -- followed by two "one-sided" losses, by five points to the Oakland Raiders, 19-14, and by four to the Bengals, 16-12, to end the year. Add it all up, and 12 of the Browns\' 16 games were decided by seven points or less. The club went just 7-5 in those games, though, which was the difference in that season from 1980, when the Browns were 10-2 in 12 contests decided by seven points or less. How tight was the 1979 season overall for the Browns? So much so that they outscored their foes by just seven points all year. The Browns moved to 4-0 -- their fastest start since 1963 -- by stunning heavily-favored Dallas 26-7 on Monday Night Football. The Browns gave up 51 points at home to the Steelers, who would go on to win their second straight Super Bowl and fourth in six years, yet scored 35 on the vaunted Steel Curtain defense and lost by 16. The game was shown on national TV, but NBC cut away to another contest, leaving only the Pittsburgh and Cleveland markets watching, after the Steelers vaulted to a 27-0 lead. RB Mike Pruitt rushed for 1,294 yards and nine TDs, while wideout Dave Logan led the team in catches with 59 and missed getting 1,000 receiving yards by just 18. Logan, TE Ozzie Newsome and veteran WR Reggie Rucker combined for 22 TD catches. The following were selected in the 1979 NFL Draft.

aS'John Jones\nDemocratic John Davis\nDemocratic Elections to the United States House of Representatives for the 29th Congress were held at different dates in the various states from July 1, 1844 (Louisiana) to November 4, 1845 (Mississippi). All 227 members of the House of Representatives elected[3] took their seats when Congress convened December 1, 1845. The elections mostly coincided with the 1844 presidential election, won by dark horse Democratic candidate James K. Polk, who won on a campaign advocating territorial expansion. The new states of Florida, Texas and Iowa were added during this Congress. Florida had actually been admitted on the last day of the 28th Congress, but was not represented until the 29th. Iowa and Texas both elected their first representatives in 1846. Despite Polk\'s victory, the Democrats had a net loss of six Representatives. They still retained a large majority of 142-79 over their major rivals, the Whigs. The American Party, based on the nativist "Know Nothing" movement characterized by opposition to immigration and anti-Catholicism, gained six seats, its first in Congress. The fragmentation of votes by this new party, combined with a generally negative political environment cause by dislike of outgoing President John Tyler, contributed to the slight Democratic loses. Five seats were added for the new States of Florida[4] (1), Iowa[5] (2), and Texas[6] (2). Florida was represented for the entirety of the 29th Congress, while Texas was unrepresented for part of the 1st session and Iowa for all of the 1st session. Yulee did not serve, being elected to the Senate. A special election was held which was, initially, won by Edward C. Cabell (W). The election was successfully challenged by William H.

At the end of 2012 the company had operations in 31 states and the District of Columbia, as well as numerous international locations over various brands.[2] The company started in 1980 with the original Landry's Seafood House Restaurant located in Katy, Texas. A year later, they opened Willie G's Seafood and Steak House in Uptown Houston. In 1986, Tilman J. Fertitta obtained controlling interest in the two restaurants and would later become the CEO of the company, which went public in August 1993.[3] Under Fertitta, the company grew rapidly through acquisition and expansion of Landry's and other restaurant concepts. In 1998, the company completed development of the 35-acre (14ha) Kemah Boardwalk, which includes restaurants, a hotel, amusement rides, and a marina. Recently the company has expanded into larger entertainment ventures, such as the Kemah Boardwalk and the Downtown Aquarium in Houston, the Tower of the Americas in San Antonio, the Downtown Aquarium in Denver. In 2003, Landry's bought Muer Seafood Restaurants, a small chain of seafood restaurants.[citation needed] In 2004 the company opened the Galveston Island Convention Center at the San Luis Resort, which was developed in a partnership with the City of Galveston, Texas.[citation needed] In 2005 the company acquired the Golden Nugget casino and hotels in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nevada. On November 17, 2006, Joe's Crab Shack was sold to J.H. Whitney & Company, a privately held company, operating as JCS Holdings, LLC. The sales price was $192 million including the assumption of liabilities. On February 14, 2011, the company announced they were purchasing the Trump Marina in Atlantic City, New Jersey for $38 million. [4] The company re-branded it as the Golden Nugget Atlantic City. [5] The sale was approved May 23, 2011, and Landry's took full control of the resort. On April 4, 2011, Fertitta made a bid to take McCormick & Schmick's private, offering $137.3 million ($9.25 per share) for the company's outstanding shares, a 30 percent premium over its April 1st closing price.[6] The offer was not accepted. Landry's later acquired the company for 8.75 a share. In December 2011, Fertitta made a bid for Morton's The Steakhouse. The bid was accepted in January 2012.[7] In November 2012, Landry's bought the Isle Casino Hotel in Biloxi, Mississippi, from Isle of Capri Casinos for $45 million.[8] The property was then renovated and rebranded as a Golden Nugget.[9] In February 2013, Landry's Inc. attempted to purchase the New York based Ark Restaurants Corp at $22 per share, but was rejected. The Ark chain owns 21 restaurants and bars along the East Coast, as well as the Foxwoods Casino and 22 fast-food catering establishments.

aS'Memoirs of an Infantry Officer is a novel by Siegfried Sassoon, first published in 1930. It is a fictionalised account of Sassoon\'s own life during and immediately after World War I. Soon after its release, it was heralded as a classic and was even more successful than its predecessor, Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man. Sassoon\'s account of his experiences in the trenches during World War I, between the spring of 1916 and the summer of 1917, creates a picture of a physically brave but self-effacing and highly insecure individual. The narrative moves from the trenches to the Fourth Army School, to Morlancourt and a raid, then to and through the Somme. The narrator, George Sherston, is wounded when a bullet passes through his lung after he incautiously sticks his head over the parapet at the battle of Arras in 1917. He is sent home to convalesce, and while there arranges to have lunch with the editor of an anti-war newspaper, the Unconservative Weekly. He determines to speak out against the war, though this contravenes military regulations and could result in his execution. The book finishes as George Sherston prepares to attend \'Slateford War Hospital\' (Craiglockhart War Hospital, Edinburgh) after a medical board had decided he was suffering from shell-shock.[1] \'A book of deep beauty and abiding significance. A book which will, I hope and believe, be read by millions.\' - Harold Nicholson \'Those who in future really want to understand the atmosphere of the years 1916 and 1917, and the conditions of life, will turn back to this book.\' - Daily Telegraph Sassoon presented his own experiences in novelistic form and therefore opted to use pseudonyms in place of names in his "George Sherston" trilogy (George Sherston being Sassoon\'s alter ego).

It was named for Malcom B. McKinnon, chairman of the County Commission when construction started in 1935. The airport opened on May 28, 1938, seven months after his death.[2] During World War II, it operated as Naval Air Station St. Simons Island and was eventually home to the Navy Radar Training School. Although NAS St. Simons Island remained an active air station following the war, its activities were eventually merged into nearby NAS Glynco and by 1947 it was finally closed as a naval air station and returned to its current use as a civilian airport. Malcolm McKinnon Airport covers an area of 320 acres (130ha) which contains two asphalt paved runways: 4/22 measuring 5,800 x 100ft (1,768 x 30 m) and 16/34 measuring 3,313 x 75ft (1,010 x 23 m).

Currently it connects the two biggest Czech cities, Prague and Brno, in the future it will link Ostrava and to the Czech-Polish border in Vovice (Karvin District) / Gorzyczki (Wodzisaw County). As of December 2011 it is 346.5km (215.3mi) long, but the planned length is 376.5km (233.9mi). With increasing automobile traffic in the 1930s in Czechoslovakia discussions were brought forward regarding the construction of new roads designed to carry the large volume of traffic. The discussions dealt with a backbone road from Bohemia, through Moravia and Slovakia to Carpathian Ruthenia with many variants. The plan of a Cheb  Plze  Nmeck Brod  Brno  ilina - Ugorod  Chust highway was the one chosen, which was sponsored by the Bata Shoes company owner Jan Antonn Baa in 1937. A year later the detailed project was ready to be realized. The Munich Agreement in 1938 deprived the country of some fundamental road and rail routes. The government hurried works for the preparation of three major infrastructure projects to the new borders, the Nmeck Brod - Brno railway, the Plze - Ostrava road and a 4-lane highway from Prague to Velk Bokov (on the Czechoslovak - Romanian border). The project for the first segment Prague - Lun was ready in January 1939, and construction began on 24 January in Chiby on the Zstizly - Lun segment. The German occupation of Czechoslovakia brought only small technical changes to the project and the construction of another segment Prague - Humpolec began in May 1939. The increasing demands of World War II slowed down the construction and the works were completely halted in 1942. After the war the works were resumed mainly on major bridges in 1946, but only with a small workforce. The segment in Chiby was abandoned in 1949 and the segment Prague - Humpolec one year later. All 77km remain in disuse. In 2008, civil engineers have said that there is an average of 50,000 motorists that passes through D1 motorways daily, 20% of the said motorists are new passers-by. In the 1960s, traffic was growing very quickly, and a new plan for a D1 highway Prague - Soviet Union border was formulated. Work on the Prague - Brno section started in 1967, mainly using the old highway route. The 21km long Prague - Miroovice segment was completed in 1971, and the 205km long route to Brno in 1980. In the Slovakian part construction started in 1973 with the 14km long Ivachnov - Liptovsk Mikul section, together with the construction of the Liptovsk Mara dam. The 19km Preov - Koice highway was added in 1980. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s the 19km long Brno - Vykov segment was built and another 20km from Liptovsk Mikul to Hybe in Slovakia. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia route changes, construction was no longer planned to Slovakia, but instead to Lipnk nad Bevou (the replacement of the planned route is the R49 expressway). Due to growing traffic near Prague, the first segment to Miroovice was widened from 4 lanes to 6 lanes and there are similar plans for widening around Brno as well. After the dissolution, no new sections were built. In 2002, construction of an 18km long extension from Vykov eastwards started and it was opened in 2005. More extensions eastwards were opened in 2008, 2009 and 2010; in 2011 motorway reach the junction with R55 expressway and R49 expressway near Huln, the route curled up to the north to the Perov (and Lipnk nad Bevou). Simultaneously the segment from Lipnk nad Bevou to Ostrava was constructed during 2004 - 2009 due to historical reasons as Motorway D47, however it was opened as part of D1 highway. The segment from Ostrava to the Polish border (and Autostrada A1) has been opened in late 2012, but only for cars under 3.5 tonnes.[1] Geographic data related to D1 motorway (Czech Republic) at OpenStreetMap'

aS'Clinical neurochemistry is the field of neurological biochemistry which relates biochemical phenomena to clinical symptomatic manifestations in humans. While neurochemistry is mostly associated with the effects of neurotransmitters and simiarly-functioning chemicals on neurons themselves, clinical neurochemistry relates these phenomena to system-wide symptoms. Clinical neurochemistry is related to neurogenesis, neuromodulation, neuroplasticity, neuroendocrinology, and neuroimmunology in the context of associating neurological findings at both lower and higher level organismal functions. The integration of knowledge concerning the molecular and cellular actions of a drug within the brain circuitry leads to an overall understanding of a neurological drug\'s action mechanisms. This understanding of drug action in turn can be extrapolated to account for system-wide or clinical manifestations which are observed as symptoms. The clinical effects of a neural drug are due to both immediate changes in homeostasis and long-term neural adaptations characterized by the phenomena neural plasticity.[1] The most basic and fundamental neurological phenomena in neuropharmacology is the binding of a drug or neurologically active substance to a cellular target. One assay to determine the extent at which a ligand binds to its receptor is the radioligand binding assay (RBA), in which specific binding of a radioactively-labeled ligand is denoted by the difference between saturated and non-saturated tissue samples. While the RBA assay assumes that the tissue prepared has just one molecular target per ligand, in actuality this may not be the case. For example, serotonin binds to many diverse serotonin receptors which makes the RIA assay quite difficult to interpret. Because many receptors are essentially enzymes, the field of pharmakinetics utilizes the Michaelis-Menten equation to describe drug affinity (dissociation constant Kd) and total binding (Bmax). Although Kd and Bmax can be determined pictorally in a normal or logarithmic plot of ligand binding vs drug concentration, Scatchard plots allow for mathematical representation of several ligand binding sites, each with its own Kd. [1] Drug potency is the measure of binding strength between a drug and a specific molecular target, whereas drug efficacy describes the biological effect exerted by the drug itself, at either a cellular or organismal level. Because drugs range widely in their potency and efficacy, drugs have been categorized on the spectrum of agonists and antagonists. Agonists bind to receptors and elicit the same effects as an endogenous neurotransmitter. For example, morphine is an agonist of the opioid receptor family. Conversely, antagonists bind to a receptor and elicit no cellular change.[2] Naloxone, an antagonist of the opioid receptors, exerts a biological effect only be interfering with endogenous neurotransmitter (morphine) binding. [2] Inverse agonists bind to receptors and elicit the opposite effect that an agonist would. The spectrum of drug continuum also includes partial agonists and partial inverse agonists, which comprise the wide majority of neurological clinical treatments. The ultimate clinical effect of a drug can be analyzed with a dose-response curve.[1] There are many biologically active chemicals which elicit an effect on the nervous system. Neurotransmitters and similarly-functioning biochemical messengers elicit effects on postsynaptic neurons at neuronal synapses. Excitatory Amino Acids include Glutamate, whereas inhibitory Amino Acids include GABA and Glycine. Additionally, catecholamines, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, and orexins have widely-projecting effects and are often referred to as neuromodulators. Neuropeptides include bradykinin, cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), galanin, MCH, MSH, Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Neurotensin, Opioids, orexin, oxytocin, somatostatin, tacykinins, TRH, CUP, and vasopressin. Purines, endogenous cannabinoids, gasses, neurotrophix factors, chemokines, and VEGF are all classified as atypical neurotransmitters. Major receptors of neurotransmitters include AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors, and Kainate Receptors.[1] Changes in the homeostatic levels of many neurologically active chemicals elicit clinical disorders and symptoms. Nociception is the form of somatic sensation that detects potentially tissue-damaging noxious stimuli. Peripheral nociceptors uniquely express transient receptor potentials which are sensitive to potentially-damaging mechanical, chemical, or thermal stimuli. Nociceptors also contain receptors for pain and inflammatory-related mediators or cytokines. Peripheral nociceptors transmit noxious stimuli to the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal horn, and further to the trigeminal ganglia in the brain. Pain has both a localizing somatic sensory component and an aversive emotional and motivational component. Pain travels through a variety of pathways via first pain on Alpha Delta fibers and second pain on slowly conducting C-fibers.[3] The dorsal horn of the spinal cord serves as a major integration center for both ascending nociceptive information and descending antinociceptive influences from the brain. Plasticity within the dorsal horn is mediated by NMDA glutamate receptors and key in the initiation of chronic pain by decreasing the excitability threshold in nociceptive pathways. Additionally, damage to neurons in nociceptive pathways leads to neuropathic pain.[4] Interestingly, three families in northern Pakistan were congenitally unable to perceive pain due to their homozygous loss of function mutation in the SCN9A gene which codes for the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 . This key finding allowed pharmacologists to begin researching if the NaV1.7 is a substantial molecular target for analgesic (antipain) medications.[5] Sensitization, in the clinical sense of the word, is a phenomenon in which nociceptors in an area beyond a tissue injury exhibit decreased thresholds for activation. Sensitization can be initiated by inflammatory prostaglandins or leukotrienes and are therefore the targets of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) which block key enzymes in their synthesis. Additionally, opioid drugs suppress nociceptions by binding to endogenous opioid receptors.[1] Sleep arousal are active brain processes medicated and associated with specific brain regions. Despite the fact that various stages of sleep are discrete and quantifiable, the exact function of sleep is unknown. Sleep is controlled both by circadian rhythms and the homeostatic drive produced by wakefulness. Circadian rhythms are produced in the suprachiasmatic nucleus by pacemaker cells which contain transcriptional regulation "clock genes" which have been highly conserved throughout evolution.[6] Non-REM sleep is initiated by neurons in the preoptic and anterior hypothalamic area, whereas REM sleep is eventually elicited by the cells in the pontine tegmentum. Electroencephalography is used to analyze brain wave patterns during sleep and has the capability to differentiate between REM sleep from non-REM sleep. Interestingly, REM sleep cycles mimic conscious brain patterns to an extent. Night Terrors, for example, involve the partial arousal out of non-REM sleep. Similarly, REM Behavior Disorder occurs when patients have fits of violent behavior during REM sleep. Benzodiazepines are the most common treatments for sleep-related disorders. Dyssomnia is a class of sleep disorders which includes Primary insomnia, primary hypersomnia, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep discorer, and other conditions. Primary insomnia is a disorder in which a patient has difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep. Behavior modification and a reduction in neurologically active substances such as caffeine and alcohol seem to be among the most promising treatments. Although the mechanism is unknown, brain plasticity and behavior modification are utilized to train patients to only go to bed when tired, associating the bed itself with a sleepy state. Narcolepsy is a condition characterized by abnormal transitions between REM and non-REM cycles during sleep and the awake cycle. Cataplexy, on the other hand, is an involuntary loss of muscle tone during wakefulness. The mechanism of narcolepsy is unknown, though recent findings suggest that orexin neurons in the lateral and posterior hypothalamus may play a critical role in reinforcing wakefulness.[7] Narcolepsy is often treated with psychostimulants or tricyclic antidepressants in order to suppress REM sleep patterns. Sleep Apnea is a common breathing disorder during sleep and is related to a disability in the central respiratory drive mechanisms. Parasomnias are a class represented by nightmares, sleep terrors, night terrors, schizophrenia, certain mood disorders, and other conditions which arise during Stage 4 of sleep. General anesthetics typically induce non-REM sleep characterized by amnesia, analgesia, immobility, and hypnosis by facilitating the inhibition of excitatory ion channels or the excitation of inhibitory ligand-gated channels. Schizophrenia is a psychological disorder in which a patient experiences symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, amotivation, social withdrawal, cognitive defects, and poor working memory. Heredity and gene inheritance is a highly important risk factor, especially for identical twins.[8] Schizophrenia is anatomically characterized by a deterioration and loss of gray matter in the temporal and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex, though the exact mechanism is unknown.[9] What is known is that the main two neurotransmitter systems implicated in schizophrenia are the dopamine and glutamate pathways. Dopamine became a candidate for research when it was clinically noticed that antipsychotic drugs which are dopamine D2 receptor antagonists were noted to be quite successful in treating schizophrenia as well.[10] Increased levels of dopamine in schizophrenics tend to induce paranoid delusions, ideas of reference, and auditory hallucinations. The same dopaminergic pathway is also involved in psychosis. Glutamate has become a candidate for treatment focus because glutamate blocks some NMDA receptors which, on their own, induce schizophrenic behavior. In animal models, NMDA antagonists increase glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex. It is postulated that this is a homeostatic response to NMDA receptor blockade, which in turn increases psychotic symptoms. A class of NMDA receptor antagonists have been denoted dissociative anesthetics because they produce a sense of depersonalization and dissociation of subjective experience from various forms of sensory input stimuli. As such, variants such as Ketamine (Angel Dust/Special K) and Phencyclidine (PCP) have become a commonly abused street-drug. These drugs are no longer used due to harmful behavioral and addictive effects.[11] Neurodegeneration is classified as a massive death of neurons, and encompasses diseases such as Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, and Huntington\'s. Although many cells die due to necrosis, many cells in neurodegenerative disorders are killed via the apoptotic pathway. Excitotoxicity, which involves overstimulation of a cell via its glutamate receptors, is one of the major processes which can initiate cell death. Other inducers include mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormal protein aggregation. Surprisingly, both necrotic and apoptotic processes utilize a similar intracellular signaling cascade which uses capsase proteins to induce cell death. Abnormal protein accumulation causes Alzheimer\'s, Parkinson\'s, and Huntington\'s diseases.[1] Alzheimer\'s Disease is the most common cause of severe memory impairment and is caused by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neuritis, and neuronal loss. It is thought that Alzheimer\'s disease may be due to unnecessary protein accumulation of  Amyloid.[12] In fact, Senile plaques are dense, protein deposits composed of amyloid  peptide. The two types of senile plaques are diffuse plaques and neuritic plaques, and differ in morphology. In addition to the amyloid, the microtubule-associated Tau protein has also been in involved with Alzheimer\'s Disease and a variety of other neurodegenerative diseases.[13] Inherited forms of Alzheimer\'s have been linked to mutation in the APP genes or presenilins which regulate APP processing. Because cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis are significantly altered during Alzheimer\'s progression, cholinergic agents such as choline and lecithin were hypothesized to augment the progression. However, these attempts were unsuccessful and the only clinically useful drugs used in the United States are cholinesterase inhibitors, which prolong the time before choline degradation.[12] Although aNMDA receptor antagonists and anti-inflammatory drugs were tested in a clinical environment, more promising clinical trials are underway to targeting the A with the immune system. Parkinson\'s Disease is caused by the loss of dopamine stimulation to the basal ganglia of the midbrain, resulting in tremor at rest and bradykinesia. In some rare forms, protein aggregation of alpha-synuclein and parkin can elicit symptoms of Parkinson\'s Disease.[14] For a variety of drugs, restoring dopamine to the central nervous system remains the target therapy. Because dopamine cannot pass the blood brain barrier on its own, the dopamine precursor L-DOPA is used in its stead. However, synaptic plasticity renders this treatment decreasingly effective with time. Another treatment option is bromocriptine, which directly stimulates D2 Dopamine Receptors.[15] Bromocriptine is less effective than L-Dopa in reducing symptoms, but provides less dyskinesia. Often, the two drugs are used in concert with one another. New approaches to treatment include deep brain simulation and cell transplantation with stem cells.Deep brain stimulation offsets symptoms rather than cures, and stem cell studies have been extremely disappointing, despite relative success with animal models. Gene therapy may provide a novel route to introduce new dopamine production via viral-medicated gene transfection, but clinical trials are yet to be completed.[16] Huntington\'s Disease is a disease characterized by minor coordination problems, jerking eye movements, and uncontrollable movement of peripheral limbs. Symptoms generally occur at the age of 40, and are often accompanied by depression and psychosis. The disease is caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene, on chromosome 4, which causes abnormally large numbers of glutamate residues in the protein. Via an unknown mechanism, this accumulation leads to neurodegeneration in the caudate nucleus and putamen, selectively destroying GABAnergic neurons which project to the globus pallidus.[17] There is also significant necrosis in the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Interestingly, cholinergic interneurons and dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain are largely unaffected. Treatment for Huntington\'s Disease is extremely limited due to the lack of knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of protein accumulation, though drugs used include dopamine receptor antagonists to minimize tremors and antidepressants to ameliorate symptoms of psychosis and depression.'

aS'Ya no hay respeto (There is no longer any respect) is a popular radio program in Aguascalientes city about myths, politics and actual themes. The distinction of the program is the way conductors talk about those topics, usually humorous and a bit lack of diplomacy. The success of the program is in part because Aguascalientes city is a very conservative place in Mexico, and the program makes fun about almost everything that is respected for the people. The editorial line is mainly liberal, and uses journalistic resources to present the information, but always using the talk show format. Because of that, the program has been censored many times by the state Government, even with direct treathens against Antonio Zapata. The broadcast is from Grupo ACIR, at 1050 AM.'

Situated in the eastern residential estate of Pasir Ris, it is the sixteenth junior college established in Singapore. Students are referred to as "Meridians". MJC was founded in 2003 after RAdm Teo Chee Hean, the then Education Minister, suggested building a new junior college in Pasir Ris. The college is led by Ms Esther Lai Choon Lian, the first and current principal. Between 2003 and 2004, the College Anthem as well as the official school logo were released. In 2005, the college hosted its official opening ceremony on 25 February, graced by RAdm Teo Chee Hean, and observed its first ever College Day on the 23rd of July. Upon admission, students commence a two year course leading to the Cambridge GCE "A" Level examinations, with up to 4 "A" Level subjects, chosen either from the Arts Faculty or the Science Faculty. As in all junior colleges, most students sit for the General Paper and Mother Tongue paper as "Higher 1", and undergo Project Work in JC1. Students with aptitude and deeper interests in their "A" level subjects sit up to "Higher 3" paper, for an advantage in bids for scholarships and further education. College facilities include a gym, rehearsal rooms for performing arts groups (with pianos and dance studios), and a library in a 2-storeyed block, run by the National Library Board. The college has a fully air-conditioned hall, five lecture theatres equipped with audio-visual equipment, and a sports block and track. Students have access to the school\'s "Integrated Virtual Learning Environment" (IVLE) for 2008 intakes, which allows students to discuss assignments online as well as access to academic databases such as "The Economist" and "Science Resource Center". There is also the MJC Leisure and Learning portal (http://intranet.mjc.edu.sg) where students can sign up for Organised Student Activities, submit suggestions and gain endorsement for participation in projects. The college has co-curricular activities (CCAs) in three groups - Sports and Games, Performing Arts and Clubs and Societies.  MJC has a student-published periodical, called "Musings@Meridian", which is headed by the College Publications Team, providing coverage on school events and articles on issues ranging from fashion to current affairs. The Students\' Council system has been restructured with the house committee being part of the council forming The Meridian Council. It is in charge of enriching school life. This change takes place after the 9th students council. As such there will be no student\'s council but only The Meridian Council. It is a group of students elected by the student body to represent student interests and to plan school events. Elections take place after a period of shortlisting and rallying, following which the council elects its own Executive Committee (EXCO) which includes the President, 2 Vice Presidents, and the 5 house captains and 5 vice captains of Atlas, Callisto, Miranda, Phobos, and Triton.\n\nCurrently, the 2nd TMC (The Meridian Council) is led by: President - Navnidh Bhalla\nVice Presidents - Khor Jia Ying and Devesh Narayanan Atlas Captain: Ryan Ong Zheng Yong\nAtlas Vice Captain: Joey Soen Jia Waye Callisto Captain: Tiffany Choo Ying Xuan\nCallisto Vice Captain: Melodie Law Jing Ying Miranda Captain: Ang Shang Le\nMiranda Vice Captain: Izza Tan Rui Yi Phobos Captain: Lee Bing Heng Leroy\nPhobos Vice Captain: Hillary Yuen Zi Yan Triton Captain: Gregory Prem Yves Arivalagan\nTriton Vice Captain: Goh See Larc Eunice Some of the activities that the SC organizes includes Orientation, Orientation Group Leaders (OGL) Recruitments and OGL camps, Council Recruitment and Council Training Camps (CTC), Teachers\' Day, J1 End of Year Bash, J2 Prom Night and an SC event whereby the SC will decide what type of event they will hold for the school.

Two people were killed and over 100 suffered light injuries.[1][2] There were 5,967 structures that sustained some damages, 1,551 declared unsafe for use and require repairment, and 138 were damaged beyond repair.[3][4] There were more than 350 weaker aftershocks including a 4.3 Mw earthquake on November 4.[5][6][7] The earthquake had magnitude of 5.3 and took place at 01:56 local time (00:56 UTC).[8] The epicenter of the earthquake was located ten kilometers north of Kraljevo near Vitanovac village. Following the earthquake electricity, phone lines and water supply were interrupted in Kraljevo region. Emergency situation was declared throughout the region. Schools as well as several dozen other structures have been sealed until the inspection verifies them as safe for use. Most damage was done near the epicenter, where around 70% of buildings in Vitanovac village have suffered damages. The Government of Serbia released emergency aid for food and supplies and announced that the aid for reconstruction will be given from budget reserve as the emergency aid budget was already spent on flood recovering during the summer.[5][9] Most of the damage was to the older structures.[10] A crack appeared on the northern facade of the 13th century ia monastery.

aS'Samuel Holmes Sheppard ((1923-12-29)December 29, 1923  April 6, 1970(1970-04-06)) was an American osteopathic physician who was found guilty and later absolved in the murder of his wife. The controversial murder trial drew widespread, nationwide attention from the media, creating what the Supreme Court later described as a "carnival atmosphere". He was initially convicted in 1954 of murdering his pregnant wife, Marilyn Reese Sheppard, and spent almost a decade in the Ohio Penitentiary before a retrial was ordered. In 1966, he was acquitted in a new trial. In 2000, Sheppard\'s son, Sam Reese Sheppard, who was seven at the time of his mother\'s murder, sued the state of Ohio for his father\'s alleged wrongful imprisonment. After a ten-week trial, a civil jury returned a unanimous verdict that Samuel Sheppard had failed to prove his father had been wrongfully imprisoned. Sheppard was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the youngest of three sons of Dr. Richard Allen Sheppard. He attended Cleveland Heights High School where he was an excellent student and was active in football, basketball, and track; he was class president for three years. Although several small Ohio colleges offered him athletic scholarships, Sheppard chose to follow the lead of his father and older brothers and pursued a career in osteopathic medicine. He enrolled at Hanover College in Indiana to study prepositional courses, then took supplementary courses at Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Sheppard finished his medical education at the Los Angeles Osteopathic School of Physicians and Surgeons and was awarded the D.O. degree. He completed his internship and a residency in neurosurgery at Los Angeles County General Hospital. A few years after marrying Marilyn Reese on February 21, 1945, in Hollywood, California, Sheppard returned to Ohio and joined his father\'s growing medical practice at Bay View Hospital. Sheppard was convicted of killing his then-pregnant wife Marilyn Sheppard in their home in the early morning hours of July 4, 1954. Sheppard claimed his wife was killed by a bushy-haired man who also attacked him and twice knocked him unconscious. The Sheppards\' lakefront home (since demolished) was at 28944 Lake Road[1] Bay Village, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, just west of the city. The property itself abutted the shore of Lake Erie, near the west end of Huntington Reservation. Sheppard faced trial in autumn 1954. The case is notable for its extensive publicity and what the U.S. Supreme Court called a "carnival atmosphere".[2] Many, such as Robert Hughes of the Heriott, TN Times Daily, have compared the O.J. Simpson trial to it, in terms of the often lurid press coverage it generated. Some newspapers and other media in Ohio[citation needed]were accused of bias against Sheppard and inflammatory coverage of the case, and were criticized for immediately labeling Sheppard as the only viable suspect. The headline "Why Isn\'t Sam Sheppard in Jail?" in The Cleveland Press indicates this bias.[3][4] The high-profile nature of the case proved to be a boon to lead prosecutor John J. Mahon, who was running for a seat on the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas as the trial began. Mahon won his seat, and served until his death on January 31, 1962. Prosecutors learned during their investigation and revealed at trial that Sheppard had carried on a three-year-long extramarital affair with Susan Hayes, a nurse at the hospital where Sheppard was employed. The prosecution argued that the affair was Sheppard\'s motive for killing his wife. Sheppard\'s attorney, William Corrigan, argued that Sheppard had severe injuries and that those injuries were inflicted by the intruder. Corrigan based his argument on the report made by noted neurosurgeon, Dr. Charles Elkins, M.D., who examined Sheppard and found that he had suffered a cervical concussion, nerve injury, many absent or weak reflexes (most notably on the left side of his body) and injury in the region of the second cervical vertebra in the back of the neck. Dr. Elkins stated that it was impossible to fake or simulate the missing reflex responses.[citation needed] The defense further argued that the crime scene was extremely bloody, and except for a small spot on his trousers, the only blood evidence on Sheppard was transfer bloodstains on his watch. Corrigan also argued that two of Marilyn\'s teeth had been broken and that the pieces had been pulled out of her mouth, suggesting she had bitten her assailant. He told the jury that Sheppard had no open wounds. (Some[who?] observers have questioned the accuracy of claims that Marilyn Sheppard lost her teeth while biting her attacker, arguing that her missing teeth are consistent with the severe beating Marilyn Sheppard took to her face and skull.)[5] However, as criminologist Paul Leland Kirk later pointed out[6] that if the beating had broken Mrs. Sheppard\'s teeth, the pieces would have been found inside her mouth, and her lips would have been severely damaged, which was not true.[citation needed] Sheppard took the stand in his own defense. He testified that he had been sleeping downstairs on a daybed when he woke to his wife\'s screams. [citation needed] Sheppard ran back downstairs and chased what he described as a "bushy-haired intruder" or "form" down to the Lake Erie beach below his home, before being knocked out again. The defense called eighteen character witnesses for Sheppard, and two witnesses who said that they had seen a bushy-haired man near the Sheppard home on the day of the crime. The jury was not convinced. On December 21, 1954, it found Sheppard guilty of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison. On January 7, 1955, shortly after his conviction, Sheppard was told that his mother had committed suicide by gunshot. Eleven days later his father died of a bleeding gastric ulcer. He was permitted to attend both funerals but was required to wear handcuffs. In 1959, Sheppard voluntarily took part in cancer studies by the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, allowing live cancer cells to be injected into his body. On July 30, 1961, after more than six years of appeals, Sheppard\'s attorney William Corrigan died. Months later, F. Lee Bailey took over as Sheppard\'s chief counsel. On February 13, 1963, his late wife\'s father Thomas S. Reese committed suicide in an East Cleveland, Ohio, motel. After several appeals were rejected, his petition for a writ of habeas corpus was granted by a United States district court judge on July 15, 1964. The State of Ohio was ordered either to free Sheppard or to grant him a new trial. The case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Sheppard v. Maxwell. The Court held that Sheppard\'s conviction was the result of a trial in which he was denied due process. The decision noted, among other factors, that a "carnival atmosphere" had permeated the trial, and that trial judge Edward J. Blythin,[7] had refused to sequester the jury, had not ordered the jury to ignore and disregard media reports of the case, and when speaking to newspaper columnist Dorothy Kilgallen shortly before the trial started said, "Well, he\'s guilty as hell. There\'s no question about it." Sheppard served ten years of his sentence. Just three days after his release, Sheppard married Ariane Tebbenjohanns, a German divorcee who had corresponded with him during his imprisonment. The two had been engaged since January 1963. Tebbenjohanns endured her own bit of controversy shortly after the engagement had been announced, confirming that her half-sister was Magda Ritschel, the wife of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels. However, Tebbenjohanns emphasized that she held no Nazi views. On October 7, 1969, Sheppard and Tebbenjohanns divorced.[8] At his new arraignment on September 8, 1966, Sheppard loudly pleaded "not guilty" with his attorney, F. Lee Bailey, by his side. Jury selection got under way on October 24, and opening statements began eight days later. Unlike in the original trial, neither Sheppard nor Susan Hayes took the stand, a strategy that proved to be successful when a "not guilty" verdict was returned on November 16. The trial was very important to Bailey\'s rise to prominence among American criminal defense lawyers. It was during this trial that Paul Kirk presented the bloodspatter evidence he collected in Sheppard\'s home in 1955 which proved crucial to his acquittal. Just three weeks later, Sheppard appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In 1975, Carson told guest George Peppard (who played Sheppard in a TV movie), that Sheppard had told him during this conversation that had he been found guilty, he would have shot himself in court. After his acquittal, Sheppard helped write the book Endure and Conquer, which presented his side of the case and gave insight into his years in prison. He also returned briefly to medicine in Youngstown, Ohio, but was sued twice for medical malpractice by the estates of dead patients. Later, Sheppard was briefly a professional wrestler, going by the ring name The Killer, and teaming with partner George Strickland in matches across the United States. In Mick Foley\'s book, Foley recounts Jim Cornette\'s telling him about Sheppard inventing the mandible claw, a submission hold Foley later made famous. In 2012, William Mason, then Cuyahoga County Prosecutor, designated the ClevelandMarshall College of Law Library at Cleveland State University as the repository for records and other materials relating to the Sheppard case.[9] The material consists of over 50 boxes of photographs, recordings and trial exhibits; the law school plans to catalog and digitize the materials, and make them available online.[9][10] Just six months before his death, Sheppard married Colleen Strickland.[11] Towards the end of his life, Sheppard was reportedly drinking "as much as two fifths of liquor a day".[12] On April 6, 1970, Sheppard died of liver failure. He was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Gardens in Columbus, Ohio. His body remained there until 1997, when he was exhumed for DNA testing as part of the lawsuit brought by his son to clear his father\'s name.[13] After the tests, the body was cremated, and the ashes were inurned in a mausoleum at Knollwood Cemetery in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, along with those of his murdered wife, Marilyn. Sheppard\'s son, Samuel Reese Sheppard, has devoted considerable time and effort towards clearing his father\'s reputation.[14] In 1999, he sued the State of Ohio in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas for his father\'s wrongful imprisonment. By order of the court, Marilyn Sheppard\'s body was exhumed, in part to determine if the fetus she was carrying when she was killed had been fathered by Dr. Sheppard. Terry Gilbert, an attorney retained by the Sheppard family, told the media that "the fetus in this case had previously been autopsied", a fact that had never previously been disclosed. This, Gilbert argued, raised questions about the coroner\'s office in the original case possibly concealing pertinent evidence.[5] Due to the passage of time and the effect of formaldehyde on the fetus\'s tissues, paternity could not be established. Gilbert was assisted by John R. Hargrove (attorney) of Florida, who was a classmate of Sam Reese Sheppard at Culver Military Academy. During Sheppard\'s civil trial, Gilbert suggested that Richard Eberling, an occasional handyman and window washer at the Sheppard home, was the likeliest suspect in Marilyn\'s murder after a ring that had belonged to Marilyn Sheppard was allegedly found in his possession. Eberling died in an Ohio prison in 1998, where he was serving a life sentence for the 1984 murder in Lakewood, Ohio of Ethel May Durkin, a wealthy widower, elderly woman, who died without any immediate family. Durkin\'s murder was uncovered when a court-appointed review of the woman\'s estate revealed that Eberling, Durkin\'s guardian and executor, had failed to execute her final wishes, which included stipulations on her burial. Durkin\'s body was exhumed and additional injuries were discovered in the autopsy that did not match Eberling\'s previous claims of in-house accidents, including a fall down a staircase in her home. Coincidentally, both of Durkin\'s sisters, Myrtle Fray and Sarah Belle Farrow, had died under suspicious circumstances as well. Fray was killed after being "savagely" beaten about the head and face and then strangled; Farrow died following a fall down the basement steps in the home she shared with Durkin in 1970, a fall in which she broke both legs and both arms. In subsequent legal action, both Eberling and his partner, Obie Henderson, were found guilty in Durkin\'s death. DNA comparison of Eberling\'s blood with blood found at the murder scene was inconclusive. Prosecutors argued that the blood evidence had been tainted in the years since it was collected, and that it potentially placed 90% of all Americans on the crime scene (blood collected from a closet door in Marilyn Sheppard\'s room was Type O, while Eberling\'s blood type was A). Eberling had admitted having been in the Sheppard home, and stated he cut his finger while washing windows and bled while on the premises. This has been cited as evidence of Eberling\'s involvement in the murder, although some questioned why Eberling would account for his blood being in the house.[7] Though Eberling denied any criminal involvement in the Sheppard case,[15] a fellow convict reported that Eberling confessed to the crime. Kathie Collins Dyal, a home healthcare worker for Durkin, also testified that Eberling had confessed to her in 1983. The credibility of both witnesses was seriously called into question during the 2000 civil trial. F. Lee Bailey, Sheppard\'s attorney during his 1966 retrial, insisted in his testimony in the 2000 civil lawsuit that Eberling could not have been the killer. Instead, Bailey suggested that Esther Houk, wife of Bay Village mayor Spencer Houk, had killed Marilyn in a fit of jealous rage after finding out that Marilyn and her husband had had an affair. The Houks were neighbors of the Sheppards. Cuyahoga County prosecutor William D. Mason led the State of Ohio\'s trial team, which included assistant prosecutors Steve Dever, Kathleen Martin, and Dean M. Boland. They argued that Sheppard was the most logical suspect, and presented expert testimony suggesting that Marilyn Sheppard\'s murder was a textbook domestic homicide. They argued that Sheppard had not welcomed the news of his wife\'s pregnancy, wanted to continue his affairs with Susan Hayes and with other women, was concerned about the social stigma that a divorce might create, and killed Marilyn to get out of his marriage. Prosecutors asked why Sheppard hadn\'t called out for help, why he had neatly folded his jacket on the daybed in which he said he\'d fallen asleep, and why the family dogwhich several witnesses had testified (in the first trial in 1954) was very loud when strangers came to the househad not barked on the night of the murder (recalling the famous Sherlock Holmes remark about "the curious incident of the dog in the night-time", with its implication that the dog knew the criminal). After ten weeks of trial, 76 witnesses, and hundreds of exhibits, the case went to the eight-person civil jury. The jury deliberated just three hours on April 12, 2000, before returning a unanimous verdict that Samuel Reese Sheppard had failed to prove that his father had been wrongfully imprisoned. On February 22, 2002, the Eighth District Court of Appeals ruled unanimously that the civil case should not have gone to the jury, as a wrongful imprisonment claim could be made only by the person actually imprisoned, and not by a family member such as Sam Reese Sheppard. Legal standing to bring such a claim, the court of appeals found, died with the person who had been imprisoned. In August 2002, the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the appeals court\'s decision.'

aS'How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed is a non-fiction book about brains, both human and artificial, by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil. First published in hardcover on November 13, 2012 by Viking Press[1] it became a New York Times Best Seller.[2] It has received attention from The Washington Post, The New York Times and The New Yorker. Kurzweil describes a series of thought experiments which suggest to him that the brain contains a hierarchy of pattern recognizers. Based on this he introduces his Pattern Recognition Theory of Mind. He says the neocortex contains 300 million very general pattern recognition circuits and argues that they are responsible for most aspects of human thought. He also suggests that the brain is a "recursive probabilistic fractal" whose line of code is represented within the 30-100 million bytes of compressed code in the genome. Kurzweil then explains that a computer version of this design could be used to create an artificial intelligence more capable than the human brain. It would employ techniques such as hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms, strategies Kurzweil used successfully in his years as a commercial developer of speech recognition software. Artificial brains will require massive computational power, so Kurzweil reviews his law of accelerating returns which explains how the compounding effects of exponential growth will deliver the necessary hardware in only a few decades. Critics felt the subtitle of the book, The Secret of Human Thought Revealed, over promises. Some protested that pattern recognition does not explain the "depth and nuance"[3] of mind including elements like emotion and imagination. Others felt Kurzweil\'s ideas might be right, but they are not original, pointing to existing work as far back as the 1980s. Yet critics admire Kurzweil\'s "impressive track record"[4] and say that his writing is "refreshingly clear"[5] contains "lucid discussions"[6] of computing history. Kurzweil has written several futurology books[7] including The Age of Intelligent Machines (1990), The Age of Spiritual Machines (1999) and The Singularity is Near (2005). In his books he develops the law of accelerating returns. The law is similar to Moore\'s Law, the persistent doubling in capacity of computer chips, but extended to all "human technological advancement, the billions of years of terrestrial evolution" and even "the entire history of the universe".[8] Due to the exponential growth in computing technologies predicted by the law, Kurzweil says that by "the end of the 2020s" computers will have "intelligence indistinguishable to biological humans".[9] As computational power continues to grow, machine intelligence will represent an ever larger percentage of total intelligence on the planet. Ultimately it will lead to the Singularity, a merger between biology and technology, which Kurzweil predicts will occur in 2045.[10] He says "There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine...".[11] Kurzweil himself plans to "stick around"[12] for the Singularity. He has written two health and nutrition books aimed at living longer, the subtitle of one is "Live Long Enough to Live Forever".[7] One month after How to Create a Mind was published, Google announced that it had hired Kurzweil to work as Director of Engineering "on new projects involving machine learning and language processing".[13] Kurzweil said his goal at Google is to "create a truly useful AI [artificial intelligence] that will make all of us smarter".[14] Kurzweil opens the book by reminding us of the importance of thought experiments in the development of major theories, including evolution and relativity.[15] He suggests his own thought experiments related to how the brain thinks and remembers things. For example he asks the reader to recite the alphabet, but then to recite the alphabet backwards. The difficulty in going backwards suggests "our memories are sequential and in order".[16] Later he asks the reader to visualize someone he has met only once or twice, the difficulty here suggests "there are no images, videos, or sound recordings stored in the brain" only sequences of patterns.[17] Eventually he concludes the brain uses a hierarchy of pattern recognizers.[18] Kurzweil writes that the neocortex contains about 300 million very general pattern recognizers, arranged in a hierarchy.[19] For example to recognize a written word there might be several pattern recognizers for each different letter stroke: diagonal, horizontal, vertical or curved. The output of these recognizers would feed into higher level pattern recognizers, which look for the pattern of strokes which form a letter. Finally a word-level recognizer uses the output of the letter recognizers. All the while signals feed both "forward" and "backward". For example if a letter is obscured, but the remaining letters strongly indicate a certain word, the word-level recognizer might suggest to the letter-recognizer which letter to look for, and the letter-level would suggest which strokes to look for. Kurzweil also discusses how listening to speech requires similar hierarchical pattern recognizers.[20] Kurzweil\'s main thesis is that these hierarchical pattern recognizers are used not just for sensing the world, but for nearly all aspects of thought. For example Kurzweil says memory recall is based on the same patterns that were used when sensing the world in the first place. Kurzweil says that learning is critical to human intelligence. A computer version of the neocortex would initially be like a new born baby, unable to do much. Only through repeated exposure to patterns would it eventually self-organize and become functional.[21] Kurzweil writes extensively about neuroanatomy, of both the neocortex and "the old brain".[22] He cites recent evidence that interconnections in the neocortex form a grid structure, which suggests to him a common algorithm across "all neocortical functions".[23] Kurzweil next writes about creating a digital brain inspired by the biological brain he has been describing. One existing effort he points to is Henry Markram\'s Blue Brain Project, which is attempting to create a full brain simulation by 2023.[24] Kurzwiel says the full molecular modeling they are attempting will be too slow, and that they will have to swap in simplified models to speed up initial self-organization.[25] Kurzweil believes these large scale simulations are valuable, but says a more explicit "functional algorithmic model" will be required to achieve human levels of intelligence.[25] Kurzweil is unimpressed with neural networks and their potential, while he\'s very bullish on vector quantization, hidden Markov models and genetic algorithms since he used all three successfully in his speech recognition work.[26] Kurzweil equates pattern recognizers in the neocortex with statements in the LISP programming language, which is also hierarchical.[27]. He also says his approach is similar to Jeff Hawkins\' hierarchical temporal memory, although he feels the hierarchical hidden Markov models have an advantage in pattern detection.[28] Kurzweil touches on some modern applications of advanced AI including Google\'s self-driving cars, IBM\'s Watson which beat the best human players at the game Jeopardy!, the Siri personal assistant in the Apple iPhone or its competitor Google Voice Search. He contrasts the hand-coded knowledge of the Douglas Lenat\'s Cyc project with the automated learning of systems like Google Translate and suggests the best approach is to use a combination of both, which is how IBM\'s Watson was so effective.[29] Kurzweil says that John Searle\'s has leveled his "Chinese Room" objection at Watson, arguing that Waston only manipulates symbols without meaning. Kurzweil thinks the human brain is "just" doing hierarchical statistical analysis as well.[30] In a section entitled A Strategy for Creating a Mind Kurzweil summarizes how he would put together a digital mind. He would start with a pattern recognizer and arrange for a hierarchy to self-organize using a hierarchical hidden Markov model. All parameters of the system would be optimized using genetic algorithms. He would add in a "critical thinking module" to scan existing patterns in the background for incompatibilities, to avoid holding inconsistent ideas. Kurzweil says the brain should have access to "open questions in every discipline" and have the ability to "master vast databases", something traditional computers are good at. He feels the final digital brain would be "as capable as biological ones of effecting changes in the world".[31] A digital brain with human-level intelligence raises many philosophical questions, the first of which is whether it is conscious. Kurzweil feels that consciousness is "an emergent property of a complex physical system", such that a computer emulating a brain would have the same emergent consciousness as the real brain. This is in contrast to people like John Searle, Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose who believe there is something special about the physical brain that a computer version could not duplicate.[32] Another issue is that of free will, the degree to which people are responsible for their own choices. Free will relates to determinism, if everything is strictly determined by prior state, then some would say that no one can have free will. Kurzweil holds a pragmatic belief in free will, because he feels society needs it to function. He also suggests that quantum mechanics may provide "a continual source of uncertainty at the most basic level of reality" such that determinism does not exist.[33] Finally Kurzweil addresses identity with futuristic scenarios involving cloning a nonbiological version of someone, or gradually turning that same person into nonbiological entity one surgery at a time. In the first case it is tempting to say the clone is not the original person, because the original person still exists. Kurzweil instead concludes both versions are equally the same person. He explains that an advantage of nonbiological systems is "the ability to be copied, backed up, and re-created" and this is just something people will have to get used to. Kurzweil believes identity "is preserved through continuity of the pattern of information that makes us" and that humans are not bound to a specific "substrate" like biology.[34] The law of accelerating returns is the basis for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore\'s Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack. It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.[35] As exponential progress continues into and beyond the Singularity, Kurzweil says "we will merge with the intelligent technology we are creating"[36]. From there intelligence will expand outward rapidly. Kurzweil even wonders whether the speed of light is really a firm limit to civilization\'s ability to colonize the universe.[37] Simson Garfinkel, an entrepreneur and professor of computer science at the Naval Postgraduate School, says Kurzweil\'s pattern recognition theory of mind (PRTM) is misnamed because of the word "theory", he feels it is not a theory since it cannot be tested. Garfinkel rejects Kurzweil\'s one-algorithm approach instead saying "the brain is likely to have many more secrets and algorithms than the one Kurzweil describes". Garfinkel caricatures Kurzweil\'s plan for artificial intelligence as "build something that can learn, then give it stuff to learn", which he thinks is hardly the "secret of human thought" promised by the subtitle of the book.[38] Gary Marcus, a research psychologist and professor at New York University, says only the name PRTM is new. He says the basic theory behind PRTM is "in the spirit of" a model of vision known as the neocognitron, introduced in 1980. He also says PRTM even more strongly resembles Hierarchical Temporal Memory promoted by Jeff Hawkins in recent years. Marcus feels any theory like this needs to be proven with an actual working computer model. And to that end he says that "a whole slew" of machines have been programmed with an approach similar to PRTM, and they have often performed poorly.[6] Josh Raulerson, a reporter and radio host who wrote his PhD thesis on the Singularity, thinks Kurzweil mistakes his PRTM theory for a comprehensive model of the mind, and thus calls the result "philosophically naive, methodologically dubious, at times intellectually dishonest -- and, above all, monstrously reductive". He feels Kurzweil confuses "the brain" with "the mind", where he thinks the mind has more depth and nuance as it can produce or ponder music, art and literature.[3] Colin McGinn, a philosophy professor at the University of Miami, asserted in The New York Review of Books that "pattern recognition pertains to perception specifically, not to all mental activity".[39] While Kurzweil does say "memories are stored as sequences of patterns"[17] McGinn asks about "emotion, imagination, reasoning, willing, intending, calculating, silently talking to oneself, feeling pain and pleasure, itches, and mood" insisting these have nothing to do with pattern recognition. McGinn is also critical of the "homunculus language" Kurzweil uses, the anthropomorphization of anatomical parts like neurons. Kurzweil will write that a neuron "shouts" when it "sees" a pattern, where McGinn would prefer he say a neuron "fires" when it receives certain stimulii. In McGinn\'s mind only conscious entities can "recognize" anything, a bundle of neurons cannot. Finally he takes objection with Kurzweil\'s "law" of accelerating change, insisting it is not a law, but just a "fortunate historical fact about the twentieth century".[39] Garfinkel says Kurzweil is at his best with the thought experiments early in the book, but says the "warmth and humanitarianism" evident in Kurzweil\'s talks is missing.[38] Marcus applauds Kurzweil for "lucid discussion" of Alan Turing and John von Neumann and was impressed by his descriptions of computer algorithms and the detailed histories of Kurzweil\'s own companies.[6] Raulerson starts by criticizing Kurzweil\'s rhetorical style and worldview as "borderline autistic", but he does praise How to Create a Mind as "informative, refreshingly transparent and often engrossing". Raulerson believes Kurzweil writes as a MIT-trained computer scientist but also as a transhumanist vitamin salesman, since he is both. Raulerson suggests Kurzweil is a figure like Nikola Tesla, not easily dismissed but not to be taken too seriously either.[3] Matthew Feeney, assistant editor for Reason, was disappointed in how briefly Kurzweil dealt with the philosophical aspects of the mind-body problem, and the ethical implications of machines which appear to be conscious. He does say Kurzweil\'s "optimism about an AI-assisted future is contagious."[40] While Drew DeSilver, business reporter at the Seattle Times, says the first half of the book "has all the pizazz and drive of an engineering manual" but says Kurzweil\'s description of how the Jeopardy! computer champion Watson worked "is eye-opening and refreshingly clear".[5] McGinn says the book is "interesting in places, fairly readable, moderately informative, but wildly overstated." He mocks the books subtitle by writing "All is revealed!" after paraphrasing Kurzweil\'s pattern recognition theory of mind. Speaking as a philosopher, McGinn feels that Kurzweil is "way of out of his depth" when discussing Wittgenstein.[39] Matt Ridley, journalist and author, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that Kurzweil "has a more impressive track record of predicting technological progress than most" and therefore he feels "it would be foolish, not wise, to bet against the emulation of the human brain in silicon within a couple of decades".[4]'

aS"John Hope (14 February 1737, Amsterdam - 1784), also known as Jan Hope, was the son of Thomas Hope and Margaretha Marcelis, first cousin of Henry Hope, father of Thomas Hope, and a follower of the Scottish Enlightenment, who is best known today for his Groenendaal Park in Heemstede, Netherlands, where he summered from 1767 to his death in 1784. Jan was an only child, born into the famous Hope banking family of Rotterdam and Amsterdam. His father had been the personal advisor to the stadtholder William V. His mother was a daughter of the wealthy Amsterdam merchant Jan Marcelis. Originally baptized as Jan in the Mennonite church, he had himself re-baptized John in the Dutch Reformed church at age 26 in order to become socially accepted in the Amsterdam regency. Unlike his cousin and business partner Henry, Jan wanted to participate in the fashionable Dutch societies that actively propagated the Scottish enlightenment. For this he needed a title and the proper religion. He became a member of the Dutch Society of Science and the Dutch Society of Letters (there he was introduced by no other than the director himself, David Ruhnken), but only after he had married Philippina Barbara van der Hoeven (1738-1790), the daughter of a Rotterdam mayor, in May 1763 and bought the castle Nederhorst den Berg for the title. Jan and Philippina had three sons, Thomas (1769-1830), Adrian Elias (1772-1834), and Henry Philip (1774-1839). After observing the 'fire engine' on display at Leiden University, he wrote to James Watt and Matthew Boulton and had his own 'fire machine', the first steam engine for a garden, installed on the high wooded grounds of his summer home. The park he purchased and expanded was located on a high sandy ridge of dunes between the Leidsevaart and Harlem Lake. He used the steam engine to pump water into his gardens, which was highly unusual, since most Dutchmen of his day were trying to discover ways of pumping water out of places. The windmill he had previously installed proved unable to provide enough water on windless days for his richly planted garden in the English style. The steam engine was installed in 1781, and worked until well after the French occupation in the 1820s. In 1842 it was broken up, for even as a curiosity it could no longer hold out against the much larger steam boiler of the Cruquius pumping station down the road. His son Adrian Elias embellished Groenendaal Park still further, including the Belevedere, a tower that has stood for a century on the hill behind the Vrijheidsbeeld, and the Walvisbank, a park bank made up of whale bones. Jan lived and worked in the Hope & Co. Amsterdam banking offices, but not very enthousiastically. Unlike his cousin, he was more interested in his summer estates, titles and show. His cousin Henry humored him and let him expand the joint art collection, used to wow the clients (often foreign heads of state). In this way, Jan's oldest son Thomas Hope (17691831) became a connoisseur of neoclassical interior decoration, and his youngest son an innovative gardener. The Hope cousins were responsible for building up the parks Groenendaal in Heemstede and the Hout in Haarlem, the two largest city parks in the area."

aS'Demokratia (Greek: ) is a direct democracy, as opposed to the modern representative democracy. It was used in ancient Greece, most notably Athens, and began its use around 500 BCE. In a participant government, citizens who wish to have a say in government can participate in it. Demokratia excluded women, foreigners, and slaves. It barred between 80 and 90 percent of the population from political rights.[1] The word demokratia comes from  demos "people" and kratos "power": "the people hold power." Demos, including the lower classes, had political equality and while respecting laws and institutions, was given full and absolute control of power and government."[2] In some languages, including Finnish, Demokratia is a word simply meaning democracy. Quoted from MODERN AMERICA AND THE RELIGION OF DEMOCRACY (Internet archive) by Loren J Samons II: In classical Athens, religion suffused every aspect of public life, from the theater to the military to the political assembly. The state (that is, the citizens) sponsored religious festivals and actively participated in the propitiation and worship of the gods. This fact well illustrates the way the various aspects of Athenian society religious, political, economic, and social overlapped with and affected one another, and the way every Athenian found himself set firmly within a matrix of duties to the gods, to his family, and to his fellow citizens. The principle of necessary duties (especially to protect the family, to serve the polis, and to propitiate the gods) formed the basic structure of Athenian society, and gave meaning to each religious, economic, military, and political act. In such an environment, it was impossible for the Athenians abjectly to worship a form of government, demokratia, even after they had made it a goddess. The idea that the "freedom to make choices" or "diversity" were absolute goods and thus could serve as goals or ideals (on a level with, much less above, family, gods, or polis) contradicted the very premises of Athenian society. Thus while democratic practices ultimately had a marked and deleterious effect on Athenian national strength and public morale and arguably contributed to the loss of Athenian independence, Athenian society managed to stave off the most harmful aspects of democratic theory. Even after they lost their democracy and autonomy, there is little evidence that the Athenians completely lost their fundamental conception of a society based on the principle of duties. I.

aS'Nimrod Pennyroyal is a recurring character in the Mortal Engines Quartet, written by Philip Reeve. He is first introduced in Predator\'s Gold and remains a major character for the rest of the series. Pennyroyal is a friendly author of adventure books which purportedly retell his travels across the world. Their authenticity is somewhat suspect, but they remain bestsellers. The historians in London criticised his work for focusing more on the adventure and romance than the history. Most of what he claims to have done is not true and is just written for the money. An exception of this is Predators Gold, which is mostly changed, still hangs on to most of the events in the story. He does seem to have some grains of historical authentication, for instance when Tom says Pennyroyal believed "the Ancients had machines called \'eye-pods\' where they could store thousands of songs on tiny little gramophone records. In "Predator\'s Gold" Pennyroyal wishes to travel with Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw. He tells Tom of his discoveries and adventures in America. Tom is amazed by Pennyroyals discoveries, but wonders why he hasn\'t heard much of them before. His bravery is first questioned when the Green Storm attacks the Jenny Haniver and Pennyroyal whimpers every time a missile comes past the airship, which is unusual for someone who has fought bears and ventured the unknown. In Anchorage, it is revealed he is actually a fraud, and that he does indeed simply make up his stories. His true cowardice is revealed when he shoots Tom (accidentally, according to Pennyroyal) and steals the Jenny Haniver to escape the great city Arkangel. After stealing the airship Jenny Haniver it is unclear what he does, but in Infernal Devices we find he has become the Mayor of Brighton, a raft resort city, which is currently sailing in the Atlantic and is running its own slave trade. After Brighton is taken over by the Lost Boys (Mortal Engines), Penyroyal escapes with Tom Natsworthy, Wren Natsworthy and Theo Ngoni. Pennyroyal perhaps redeems his past when he kills the Stalker Fang with an anti-Stalker gun and writes a new book closer to the truth, however no one will publish it after his books had been revealed as lies in a newspaper called The Speculum.

It is located in the Pyrenees exactly in the actual administrative comarca of Alt Urgell, that last includes Barid, Urgellet and the banks of Oliana, Peramola and Bassella. The territory of Urgellet is almost Alt Urgell, except the Eastern (Barid) and the southern sector. The Strait of Mollet represents the natural boundary between Urgellet and Barid. The history of Urgellet is highly related to Sedes Urgelli (La Seu d'Urgell or city of Urgell), the Bishop of Urgell and the County of Urgell. In the latter case, the territory Urgellet was leading the county, with capital in la Seu d'Urgell, and extended southwards up to the comarques of Urgell and Pla d'Urgell, among others. For this reason some towns and two comarques in Lleida contain the name of Urgell that has its origin in the city of Urgell and Urgellet region. The name Urgell, as linguist Joan Coromines think, has a pre-Roman origin. The author interprets the meaning is related to the presence of water, which is plausible if this is the origin of the name specifically Pyrenean."

aS'Margarita Simonyan (Russian:   ) (born 6 April 1980 in Krasnodar, Soviet Union) is a Russian journalist of Armenian descent. She is the Editor-in-Chief of the English-language, autonomous non-profit, government-funded[1] global multilingual television news network RT (formerly "Russia Today").[2][3][4] Simonyan was born in Krasnodar, Russia, just northeast of the Black Sea. She is from a working class family and decided at an early age she wanted to become a journalist. She first worked for the local newspaper, and then for a local television station while studying journalism at Kuban State University.[5] Simonyan spent a year in Bristol, New Hampshire in a student exchange program visit.[4] She says during that time she discovered Russians and Americans "are so much alike in terms of culture, in terms of family values, ways of life, reactions, sense of humor".[5][6] Simonyan covered the Second Chechen War and serious flooding in Russia\'s south for her local television station, receiving an award for "professional courage". In 2002, she became a regional correspondent for Russia\'s national Rossiya television channel and covered the 2004 Beslan school hostage crisis.[7] Simonyan, one of the first journalists to arrive at the scene, witnessed the killing of 334, 186 of them children. She told an interviewer "It was the worst thing that ever happened to me," and that she cried frequently while trying to write about it. She then moved to Moscow and joined Rossiya\'s pool of Kremlin reporters.[5][6] She was the first Vice-President of the Russian National Association of TV and Radio Broadcasters and a member of The Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation. In 2010 her first book, Heading to Moscow! was published.[4][8] Simonyan was only 25 when appointed editor-in-chief in 2005, but had been working in journalism since she was 18.[9] Some sources describe her as a Kremlin loyalist[10] who is close to the Putin regime.[11][12][13][14] She admits that Vladimir Putin once sent her flowers,[9] Though when asked about the flowers incident Simonyan played it down "At a press conference, where President Putin was talking with the President of Tajikistan. It was my twenty-fifth birthday, which is a special anniversary. The other journalists were talking about it, the President heard them, and that was how I received the flowers. It was very spontaneous. I dont think that you can call it a presidential high regard".[15] Simonyan has explained to reporters that after the fall of the Soviet Union many older Soviet journalists were not wanted by new media enterprises which preferred less experienced young journalists, thus the youth of most of the staffers.[6][9] RT started broadcasting on 10 December 2005 with a staff of 300 journalists, including approximately 70 from outside Russia.[16] Simonyan frequently addresses media questions about RT\'s journalistic and political stands. At its launch, Simonyan stated that RT\'s intent was to have a "professional format" like the BBC, CNN and Euronews that would "reflect Russia\'s opinion of the world" and present a "more balanced picture" of Russia.[17] She also told a reporter that the government would not dictate content and "Censorship by government in this country is prohibited by the constitution."[18] She later told the Moscow Times that RT started to grow once it became provocative and that controversy was vital to the station. She said that RT\'s task was not to polish Moscow\'s reputation.[19] She discussed her views of RT\'s coverage of the 2008 South Ossetia war, where Russia backed South Ossetia against the country of Georgia, with the Washington Times. She stated that among English speaking channels, only RT was giving the South Ossetian side of the story. She rejected the allegation of Will Dunbar, an RT correspondent who left after alleging RT was downplaying Russian bombing raids, and denied his claims of censorship. She stated that compared to some other stations, "We are not making a secret out of the fact that we are a Russian station, and, of course, we see the world from a Russian point of view. We are being much more honest in that sense."[6]'

aS'Notes: The Sotho language (Sesotho) has traditional names for the months of the familiar Gregorian calendar. The names reflect a deep connection that the Sotho people (Basotho) traditionally have with the natural world and the importance of agriculture. Although the month names are often not used by the general public (being considered part of "deep Sesotho"), they are regularly used in news broadcasts and other media and are more common than English imports. Additionally, the names of the seasons and the days of the week are regularly used by all speakers.  The names of the months (dikgwedi) indicate special natural and agricultural events which traditionally happened during the period. Being cattle breeders who lived in the semi-arid regions of Southern Africa, a deep understanding of agriculture and the natural world was essential for the survival of the Basotho people. The year begins roughly in the month of August, when the seeds are planted in anticipation of the next month\'s explosion of life.[1] Like many other African societies, Sesotho speaking people generally recognise only 2 seasons (dihla). However, names do exist for all four of the traditional Western seasons. The year begins in approximately August or September, when the crops are planted. The concept of dividing the month into four 7-day weeks (dibeke, from Afrikaans "week") is a recent European innovation. The week begins on Monday.'

Squadron flies Block 42 F-16Cs, tail code "LF", 69th FS carrying a black tail band. Activated in 1941 as a single-engine fighter operational and replacement training unit, initially assigned to III Fighter Command, reassigned to I Fighter Command in 1942. Used P-39 Aircobras and P-40 Warhawks for training. Converted to an operational squadron, 1943, re-eqipped with P-47 Thunderbolts. Deployed to South Pacific Area, 1943, being assigned to Thirteenth Air Force. Began combat operations in February 1944, providing protection for U.S. bases and escorting transports initially, then escorting bombers over New Guinea and sea convoys to Admiralty Islands. From Noemfoor, bombed and strafed Japanese airfields and installations on Ceram, Halmahera, and the Kai Islands. Moved to the Philippines in Nov, flew fighter sweeps against enemy airfields, supported U.S. ground forces, and protected sea convoys and transport routes. Beginning in July 1945, attacked railways, airfields, and enemy installations in Korea and Kyushu, Japan from Okinawa. After V-J Day, flew reconnaissance missions over Japan. Moved without personnel or equipment to the Philippines in December and demobilized, aircraft sent to depots in the Philippines, inactivated in January 1946. Reactivated at Tageu AB (K-2) South Korea in 1952, absorbing Federalized Texas Air National Guard personnel and F-84D Thunderjets. Squadron provided close air support for United Nations ground forces and attacked enemy airfields and installations. Transitioned in late 1952 to the new F-84G, designed with more speed and range. New targets included enemy ports, railroads, and airfields. The squadron attacked the major supply port of Sinuiju in September, inflicting heavy damage without loss of personnel or aircraft. Combining with other fighter-bomber units, it attacked the Kumgang Political School at Odong-ni in October 1952 and the North Korean tank and infantry school at Kangso in February 1953. In May, the 58th FBG bombed North Korean dams, flooding enemy lines of communication and rice fields. On 27 July 1953, attacked runway at Kanggye and, with the 49 FBG, bombed Sunan Airfield for the final action of fighter-bombers in the Korean War. Re-equipped with F-86 Sabres after the 1953 armistice, remained in South Korea to enforce cease-fire with North Korea, squadron elements rotating frequently to Taiwan until inactivated in 1958 due to budget reductions. Reactivated at Luke AFB, Arizona in October 1969 when the 58th Tactical Fighter Training Wing (TFTW) was activated, replacing the provisional 4510th CCTW as the host unit at Luke. Concurrently, the 69th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (TFTS) and the 418th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (TFTS) were activated as F-104G training units, replacing the provisional 4512th CCTS and 4518th CCTS to support Foreign Military Sales of the F-104. Pilots from Greece, Norway, Turkey, Denmark, and Spain were trained at Luke. In addition, many F-104Gs owned by the West German Luftwaffe actually operated with the 58th TFTW where they sported USAF insignia and carried USAF serial numbers. Training of West German Air Force pilots in the F-104G continued until late 1982. The Germans flew more than 900 Starfighters totaling an excess of 269, 750 hours and produced 1,868 F-104 pilots. The 69th TFTS inactivated on 16 March 1983 Reactivated as an F-4E Phantom II tactical fighter squadron at Moody AFB, Georgia on 1 July 1983, assuming the personnel and aircraft of the 339th Tactical Fighter Squadron which inactivated the same day. Tail coded "MY", carried a silver/red tail stripe. Conducted frequent exercise deployments in the U.S. and overseas to maintain capabilities specializing in air-to-ground attack using precision-guided weapons. Transitioned to F-16A/B aircraft, 19881989, and oriented mission planning toward NATO requirements by conducting squadron-strength deployments to Europe. Began upgrading to F-16C/D in Jan 1990 and in Aug 1990 became first operational TAC unit to employ the LANTIRN all-weather/night navigation and bombing system. Deployed to Southwest Asia, JanuaryFebruary 1991, engaging in combat operations during Operation Desert Storm flying more than 1,500 combat sorties. Following the ceasefire, continued to support peace-keeping operations with periodic aircraft deployments to Saudi Arabia. Continued training operations from Moody AFB throughout the 1990s, stood down in early 2001 when Moody was realigned to a Rescue/Special Operations base and host 347th Fighter Wing was inactivated.[1] Reactivated in February 2010 at Luke AFB in the Air Force Reserve with a mission to train Air Force Reserve Command pilots in combat tactics with the F-16 Fighting Falcon.

The species was first found in Avakubi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has been recorded in Cameroon. Dippenaar-Schoeman & Jocqu (1997) give the distribution range as Zad're to Ethiopia. The genus name is derived in part from the arachnologist Lessert, and also from the salticid genus Pellenes, because it bears resemblance to several genera in the subfamily Pelleninae. Its original genus name Avakubia was changed in 1929, because that name was preoccupied for a gastropod subgenus (Gulella (Avakubia) Pilsbry, 1919, Streptaxidae, Stylommatophora)."

aS'An extrinsic semiconductor is a semiconductor that has been doped, that is, into which a doping agent has been introduced, giving it different electrical properties than the intrinsic (pure) semiconductor. Doping involves adding dopant atoms to an intrinsic semiconductor, which changes the electron and hole carrier concentrations of the semiconductor at thermal equilibrium. Dominant carrier concentrations in an extrinsic semiconductor classify it as either an n-type or p-type semiconductor. The electrical properties of extrinsic semiconductors make them essential components of many electronic devices. Semiconductor doping is the process that changes an intrinsic semiconductor to an extrinsic semiconductor. During doping, impurity atoms are introduced to an intrinsic semiconductor. Impurity atoms are atoms of a different element than the atoms of the intrinsic semiconductor. Impurity atoms act as either donors or acceptors to the intrinsic semiconductor, changing the electron and hole concentrations of the semiconductor. Impurity atoms are classified as donor or acceptor atoms based on the effect they have on the intrinsic semiconductor. Donor impurity atoms have more valence electrons than the atoms they replace in the intrinsic semiconductor lattice. Donor impurities "donate" their extra valence electrons to a semiconductor\'s conduction band, providing excess electrons to the intrinsic semiconductor. Excess electrons increase the electron carrier concentration (n0) of the semiconductor, making it n-type. Acceptor impurity atoms have fewer valence electrons than the atoms they replace in the intrinsic semiconductor. They "accept" electrons from the semiconductor\'s valence band. This provides excess holes to the intrinsic semiconductor. Excess holes increase the hole carrier concentration (p0) of the semiconductor, creating a p-type semiconductor. Semiconductors and dopant atoms are defined by the column of the periodic in which they fall. The column definition of the semiconductor determines how many valence electrons its atoms have and whether dopant atoms act as the semiconductor\'s donors or acceptors. Group IV semiconductors use group V atoms as donors and group III atoms as acceptors. Group III-V semiconductors, the compound semiconductors, use group VI atoms as donors and group II atoms as acceptors. Group III-V semiconductors can also use group IV atoms as either donors or acceptors. When a group IV atom replaces the group III element in the semiconductor lattice, the group IV atom acts as a donor. Conversely, when a group IV atom replaces the group V element, the group IV atom acts as an acceptor. Group IV atoms can act as both donors and acceptors; therefore, they are known as amphoteric impurities. Extrinsic semiconductors with a larger electron concentration than hole concentration are known as n-type semiconductors. The phrase \'n-type\' comes from the negative charge of the electron. In n-type semiconductors, electrons are the majority carriers and holes are the minority carriers. N-type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with donor impurities. In an n-type semiconductor, the Fermi energy level is greater than that of the intrinsic semiconductor and lies closer to the conduction band than the valence band. As opposed to n-type semiconductors, p-type semiconductors have a larger hole concentration than electron concentration. The phrase \'p-type\' refers to the positive charge of the hole. In p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the minority carriers. P-type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with acceptor impurities. P-type semiconductors have Fermi energy levels below the intrinsic Fermi energy level. The Fermi energy level lies closer to the valence band than the conduction band in a p-type semiconductor. Extrinsic semiconductors are components of many common electrical devices. A semiconductor diode (devices that allow current in only one direction) consists of p-type and n-type semiconductors placed in junction with one another. Currently, most semiconductor diodes use doped silicon or germanium. Transistors (devices that enable current switching) also make use of extrinsic semiconductors. Bipolar junction transistors (BJT) are one type of transistor. The most common BJTs are NPN and PNP type. NPN transistors have two layers of n-type semiconductors sandwiching a p-type semiconductor. PNP transistors have two layers of p-type semiconductors sandwiching an n-type semiconductor. Field-effect transistors (FET) are another type of transistor implementing extrinsic semiconductors. As opposed to BJTs, they are unipolar and considered either N-channel or P-channel. FETs are broken into two families, junction gate FET (JFET) and insulated gate FET (IGFET). Other devices implementing the extrinsic semiconductor:'

aS"Lalmatia Colliery was a private, underground coal mine at Lalmatia, Distt- Santhal Paragana (now in Godda District a breakaway part of Santhal Paragana). After nationalisation of non-coking coal mines in India during 1973, this mine was taken over by the Indian government and came under Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited). Until the early 1990s, the mine produced around 100 tons of coal per day. It was located 34km North of Godda in the Godda district, in the Indian state of Jharkhand. This suburban area was ECL's largest opencast project.

aS"Coordinates: 505732N 31633W / 50.9589N 3.2757W / 50.9589; -3.2757 Sampford Arundel is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England. It is situated near Wellington and 10 miles (16.1km) south west of Taunton in the Taunton Deane district. The village has a population of 334.[1] The parish, which lies at the western end of the Blackdown Hills, includes the hamlets of Bagley Green, Sampford Moor, White Ball and Beam Bridge where a temporary terminus of the Bristol and Exeter Railway was established in 1843 until the line was completed to Exeter in 1844.[2] There is a Junior School, an interesting church and an old telephone box. There are no shops and few street lamps. There is a cricket club and the main attraction for visitors is the countryside. The first part of the name 'Sampford' means sandy ford and the second part 'Arundel' commemorates Roger Arundel who was granted the manor by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, and to differentiate the village from Sampford Brett.[3] The parish of Sampford Arundel was part of the Milverton Hundred,[4] The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the councils operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Taunton Deane, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Wellington Rural District.[5] The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Taunton Deane county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. The Anglican parish Church of the Holy Cross has 14th century origins and a 15th century tower, However the rest of the church was largely rebuilt and the tower restored in the 1870s. It has been designated as a Grade II listed building.[6] The church was given by the Arundels to Canonsleigh Priory which retained it until the dissolution of the monasteries.[3] Media related to Sampford Arundel at Wikimedia Commons"

aS'In a radio antenna, the feed line is the cable or other transmission line that connects the antenna with the radio transmitter or receiver. In a transmitting antenna, it feeds the radio frequency (RF) current from the transmitter to the antenna, where it is radiated as radio waves. In a receiving antenna it transfers the tiny RF voltage induced in the antenna by the radio wave to the receiver. In order to carry RF current efficiently, feed lines are made of specialized types of cable called transmission line. The most widely used types of feed line are coaxial cable, twin-lead, ladder line, and at microwave frequencies, waveguide. Particularly with a transmitting antenna, the feed line is a critical component that must be adjusted to work correctly with the antenna and transmitter. Each type of transmission line has a specific characteristic impedance. This must be matched to the impedance of the antenna and the transmitter, to transfer power efficiently to the antenna. If these impedances are not equal it can cause a condition called standing waves on the feed line, in which the RF energy is reflected back toward the transmitter, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter. This adjustment is done with a device called an antenna tuner in the transmitter. Twin lead is also called parallel wire. It is two conductors molded into an insulating material and running alongside one another in a flat and parallel ribbon-like wire. The distance between the two wires is small relative to the wavelength of the RF signal carried on the wire. Furthermore, the RF current in one wire is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the RF current on the other wire (it is inverted). Thus, if both wires radiate energy equally, the radiated energies will cancel each other out and there will be near zero radiation at any distance from the wire. Twin lead is also immune to external noise or RF energies. Any unwanted external noise or unwanted RF energy induced on the wire from external energy sources will be induced in both wires at the same time and equally in magnitude and direction. At the end of the transmission line the inverted signal wire is restored to normal (non-inverted now) and added back to the original non-inverted signal wire by the receiving circuitry. Any noise will now be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction and cancel itself out. Twin lead is considered a balanced transmission line. Coaxial cable is a rounded cable with a center conductor and a braided or solid metallic shield, usually copper or aluminum. The center conductor is separated from the outer shield by a dielectric, which is usually foam, air or a compressed gas such as nitrogen. The shield is covered with an outer cable sheath. Coaxial cable is considered an unbalanced line. A waveguide is a hollow metallic conductor with a circular or square cross-section. The RF signal travels along the inside of the tube, guided by its size and shape, similar to the way sound travels in a tube. The metallic construction of the wave guide keeps it from radiating energy outwards and also prevents unwanted energy from entering the waveguide. A waveguide is considered an unbalanced transmission line. This is a comparison of a few common feed line characteristics. Larger lists are available in other articles, references, and directly from manufacturers.'

aS'The Pepsi Generation was the theme of an advertising campaign for Pepsi-Cola, a U.S. brand of soft drink, that launched in 1963. It was the brainchild of Alan Pottasch, a Pepsico advertising executive. It invited consumers to "Come Alive! You\'re the Pepsi Generation!" Earlier campaigns for Pepsi-Cola had emphasized price competition. Twelve ounce Pepsi bottles gave you twice as much soft drink as six ounce standard Coca-Cola bottles, and Coca-Cola was by far the leading brand of soft drink. Pepsi formerly ran a campaign that featured the jingle: This jingle focused on the simple proposition that Pepsi was just as good as Coke, but a better value. The Pepsi Generation campaign represented a major shift away from that line of thinking; rather than being just as good as Coke, Pepsi was different from Coke. The Pepsi Generation and its associated jingle  told Pepsi drinkers, now enrolled in the Pepsi Generation, that Pepsi-Cola was taking a stand with the "young" side of the 1960 era "generation gap". Television ads featuring the campaign typically displayed young people pursuing exotic entertainments like motorcycle or watercycle riding or piloting a windship through a desert, while an announcer described Pepsi drinkers as people who saw the "young view of things". "Who is the Pepsi Generation? Livelier, active people with a liking for Pepsi-Cola!"[2] Previous Coca-Cola advertisements had featured Norman Rockwell styled images of small towns and nostalgic scenes, as well as traditional figures such as Santa Claus. Pepsi told soft drink consumers that there are Coke people, and there are Pepsi people, and if you\'re a Pepsi person you are young, and the future\'s on your side.[3] Pottasch, creator of the campaign, said that "For us to name and claim a whole generation after our product was a rather courageous thing that we weren\'t sure would take off." The "Pepsi Generation" was one of the first and best known instances of what came to be known as "lifestyle marketing". It focused on portraying Pepsi drinkers as possessing desirable qualities such as youth, rather than on the characteristics of the product itself. Pottasch said that "Pepsi was young, spirited, people doing active thingsplaying volleyball on the beach.... but younger we said in mind, in attitude, in feeling. Young in spirit. Young in heart."[4] Pottasch repeated the themes of the Pepsi Generation with the 1984 campaign, "The Choice of a New Generation".'

aS'The Science Technology Engineering Mathematics Education Program (ESEP) is a science and mathematics-oriented curriculum devised for high schools in the Philippines. The ESEP program is offered by specialized high schools, whether public or private, supervised by the Department of Education. Currently, there are 110 high schools offering the ESEP program, the majority being public. All three types of science high schools in the Philippines (ESEP high schools, high schools in the Regional Science High School Union and the Philippine Science High School System) offer a curriculum placing importance in mathematics and the sciences, as well as research. It is noted though that the RSHS Union and the PSHS System have higher standards of science and mathematics education than ESEP high schools. Likewise, ESEP high schools and the RSHS Union are operated by Department of Education, while the PSHS system is operated by Department of Science and Technology. In ESEP high schools, transfer students are permitted to enroll provided the student is coming from another ESEP high school, from an RSHS or from the PSHS System. In the Regional Science High School Union and the PSHS System, transfers are only allowed within their respective systems for incoming sophomores only. Students who wish to transfer from an ESEP high school to the RSHS or PSHS systems will not be admitted, although the reverse is permissible. All three types of science high school also maintain different grading systems. ESEP high schools and the RSHS Union apply the standard grading system for high schools in the Philippines, while the PSHS System maintains a unique grading system using the 1.00-5.00 scale. Integrated Science Advanced Biological Science (BIO2) Physics I (Basic Physics); Physics II (Advanced Physics) Basic Statistics Mathematics II-B (Geometry) Analytic Geometry Advanced Statistics Linear Algebra The Tech-Voc program seeks to provide early training for labor skills, particularly on machine works, trade, agriculture, information technology, among others. The program is offered to graduating high school students and its main purpose is to either prepare them for college or to enable them to work in various industries. The technical-vocational program has 18 areas of specialization which includes: machine shop, automotive technology, welding, electronics technology, building construction, furniture and cabinet making, plumbing, electricity, computer technology, food processing, animal production, fish processing, fish capture, fish culture, agriculture, PC operations and technical drawing. Currently, there are 280 Tech-Voc High Schools in the Philippines, 140 of which are priority Tech-Voc High Schools. The Special Program in Sports is in the line with efforts of the DepEd to institutionalize a program that will identify / discover students with potential sports talents and train them for higher levels of athletic competitions. The Special Program for Sports offers a four year secondary curriculum patterned after that of a regular high school, with specialization in sports. for more information, please see the "Special Program in the Arts" article in English-language WikiPilipinas. for more information, please see the "Special Program in Journalism" article in English-language WikiPilipinas. As part of the expansion program of the Department of Educations\' Engineering and Science Education Program, the Special Science Elementary School was established, to serve as feeder school for science high schools. This program envisions developing Filipino children who are equipped with scientific and technological knowledge, skills and attitudes; creative and have positive values; and lifelong learning skills to become productive partners in the development of the community and society and it aims to determine the qualities that science inclined learners possess; describe the characteristics of a good special elementary school; and determine the factors inputted into the SSES that significantly contribute to the improved performance of the learners involved in the study. Currently there are 57 special science elementary schools entire the Philippines. SSES, according to the guidelines should have state of the art technology that provides for standard size classrooms of 7 meters by 9 meters with at least two computers, a television set, cassette recorder, player LCD projector, OHP, VHS/VCD/DVD player for every classroom. The classrooms should also have science laboratories, computer laboratory with multimedia and internet facilities; speech laboratory; music room and musical instruments and a gym with functional sports facilities.[1] '

aS'Liberty Shoes Ltd was a shoe-manufacturing company in Leicester, England. Its premises were located in the Liberty Building in central Leicester, an architecturally-significant building that was demolished amid some controversy in 2002. The company was founded by the Lennard Brothers in 1877. One brother, Samuel, served as a town councillor in Leicester, and later became mayor of the city.[1] The firm was initially known as the Lennard Shoe Company, and appears in trade directories as early as 1887.[2][3] By the early twentieth century, the company specialised in the production of high-quality footwear for women.[4] At its peak the company employed 650 people, and was an important force in the local community; but by the 1960s it had entered a period of decline, and its eventual closure began with 200 layoffs in 1962.[5][4] The Liberty Building was opened in 1919, and the well-known Statue of Liberty replica was added two years later  it was from this statue that both the building and the company would soon get their name.[6][7][8] The building used state-of-the-art construction techniques for its time, including the Hennebique system of reinforced concrete.[9] When completed, the internal space measured 42,000 square feet.[10] In 1992 an application to demolish the buildings was made for the first time  two years later, the building was granted Grade II listed status. By this time the building had been vacated, and regularly suffered from vandalism and intrusion.[11] Its final use was as offices and the location of a printing works.[3] After much further campaigning, the building was demolished in April 2002.[12] The Liberty statue was relocated to a nearby roundabout, and student accommodation was built on the site.[13]'

She is the daughter of poet Barbara Wolf, and 1940\'s cinematographer Joe Wolf. Her photographs are housed in museums, libraries, and private collections internationally, including the Bibliothque Nationale, Paris, France; Le Zilvermuseum Het Sterckshof, Belgium; Le Musee Reatu, Arles, France, and the Photographic Center of the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum, Tokyo, Japan. She currently lives and teaches between her home in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and Mexico.[1] Wolf began her photography career as a teenager working with Fanny,[2] one of the first all-girl rock bands to be signed by a major label, and became an official photographer for the Joe Cocker Mad Dogs and Englishmen Tour (1970).[3] From 1970-1975, she lived and studied in Provence, France, attending the Institute of American Universities, and L\'Ecole Experimental Photographic.[4] Her early photographic work in France focused on people and village life in the Vaucluse Mountains.[5] Upon returning to the US, Wolf taught photography through the University of California at Los Angeles Extension, worked as a staff photographer for the Los Angeles Citywide Mural Project[6] and became a founding member of the organization, Women in Photography International.[7] In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wolf created a public art project of bus bench murals consisting of photos of ordinary people sitting on bus benches. The photographs were placed on the sides of buses and the back of bus benches in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Oakland, CA, and Arles, France. The benches were conceived as a response to the dehumanizing effects of advertising,[8][9][10] and were exhibited in numerous venues including the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery and the Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie International Festival of Photography in Arles, France.[11] She then developed the project, "L.A.

He has also published the book Words (2010) under the conceptual pseudonym Andy Devine.[2][3] Kimball\'s literary works have been recognized and highlighted at Michigan State University in their Michigan Writers Series.[4] Kimball is the recipient of a grant from the New York Foundation for the Arts, a Boswell and Johnson Award, and the Lidano Fiction Prize. His short fiction has also appeared in numerous literary magazines, including Open City, Prairie Schooner, Post Road andGigantic (magazine). Sam Lipsyte (author of Home Land, The Subject Steve, and Venus Drive) calls Kimball "a hero of contemporary fiction."[5] Kimball is responsible for a collaborative art project, "Michael Kimball Writes Your Life Story (on a postcard)",[6] which he performs at festivals; the project was covered in The Guardian.[7] Kimball was also featured on NPR\'s All Things Considered. Working with Luca Dipierro, Kimball produced two documentaries, I Will Smash You (2009) and 60 Writers/60 Places (2010).[8] Big Ray was published in 2012.[9] Sam Lipsyte, author of The Ask, says Michael Kimball has been writing innovative, compelling and beautifully felt books for years, but Big Ray seems a break-through and culmination all at once. It\'s funny and terrifying and it\'s his masterpiece, at least so far. Jon McGregor, author of This Isnt the Sort of Thing That Happens to Someone Like You, calls Big Ray An uncompromising work of power and grace. I finished reading it a week ago, but I still can\'t put it down."[citation needed] Us was published by Tyrant Books in 2011.[10] The novel was originally published in the UK and translated as How Much of Us There Was. Us was called ""The best little novel you haven\'t heard about by Oprah\'s Reading List.[11] Time Out Chicago gave Us 5 stars: "The sentences and even paragraphs simulate the stunned but dutiful response to the suffering of a loved one: short, raw and somewhat elliptical, wrapping themselves around the small tasks at hand and the larger questions constantly raised. ... Kimballs short chapters cast such a hypnotic spell, the reader is able to plug directly into the characters grief. Its a simply gorgeous and astonishing book, the kind that makes the outside world disappear once you open its pages."[12] Dear Everybody (2008) was published in the US and Canada, and in the UK, Australia, and South Africa. It has been translated into Greek, Korean, Chinese-Complex, and Chinese-Simplified. Dear Everybody developed from a short story published in Post Road Magazine called "Excerpts from the Suicide Letters of Jonathon Bender (b. 1967-d.2000)."[13] Both Stephen King and Dave Eggers selected it for their lists of notables in The Best American Series Best American Short Stories and Best American Non-Required Reading. Time Out-New York says that Dear Everybody includes "stunning prose" and that the letters "harbor such a strange emotional power that youll find them hard to forget."[14] The LA Times comments: "There is a whole life contained in this slim novel, a life as funny and warm and sad and heartbreaking as any other, rendered with honest complexity and freshness by Kimball\'s sharp writing."[15] Jonathon Bender, the main character, had something to say, but the world wouldnt listen. Thats why he writes to everybody he has ever knownincluding his mother and father, his brother and other relatives, his childhood friends and neighbors, the Tooth Fairy, his classmates and teachers, his psychiatrists, his ex-girlfriends and his ex-wife, the state of Michigan, a television station, and a weather satellite. Taken together, these unsent letters tell the remarkable story of Jonathons life. Christine Schutt, author of Florida, writes of Dear Everybody that In Benders unsent letters of apology or thanks, Michael Kimball transforms the familiar into the strange again and the simplest confessions are made moments of sublime wonder.[16] Italian filmmaker and artist Luca Dipierro made a short film based on Dear Everybody.[17] Kimball\'s second novel, How Much of Us There Was,[18] is the story about a man\'s love for his wife as she dies and how he attempts to manage his grief. Meanwhile, their adult grandson learns from them what real love is. Rebecca Seal, in The Observer, called it "powerful and moving."[19] Mariko Kato in Time Out London observes: "A deep love between an aging husband and wife is given a heartbreaking voice in Michael Kimballs second novel  Told through the eyes of the husband, the story is tender and poignant. His despair moves us because it is neither fantastic nor indulgent."[citation needed] Betty Williams of Telegraph & Argus writes, "This is the saddest book I have ever read and one of the most beautiful and unusual."[20] Kimball\'s first novel, The Way the Family Got Away, is the story of a family who suffers from the tragedy of an infant son dying. Told from the alternating perspectives of the surviving boy and girl, the novel takes the reader on an emotional journey across the American landscape, as both children try, in their different ways, to reconcile what their family was with what it has become. The Times called Kimball\'s novel "moving and clever: the open road, so long a symbol of freedom and self-discovery in American fiction, is here rendered as denuded of promise, embodying desertion, desolation and rootlessness. ... Kimballs novel reads as parable about the death of the family, of how impossible family life is in a numbedly materialistic society.[citation needed] The Way has been translated into Italian,[21] Dutch,[22] German,[23] Portuguese, Spanish,[24] and Hebrew.'

aS'Panfilo "Ping" Morena Lacson, Sr. (born June 1, 1948) is a Filipino politician who served as Philippine senator, serving from 2001 to 2013. He served as the Director-General of the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001 before being elected to the Philippine Senate. Panfilo Morena Lacson was born in Imus, Cavite on June 1, 1948.[1] He finished grade school at the Bayan Luma Elementary School in 1960, and high school at the Imus Institute in 1964. He completed Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy at the Lyceum of the Philippines University and in 1967, attended the Philippine Military Academy. He was commissioned in the Philippine Constabulary after his graduation in 1971. He earned a postgraduate degree of Master in Government Management from the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila in 1996. Lacson worked at the Metropolitan Command (Metrocom) Intelligence and Security Group (MISG) from 1971 to 1986, during which time he was one of the arresting officers of student activist and martial law critic Abraham Sarmiento, Jr.. He also served at the the PC-INP Anti-Carnapping Task Force from 19861988, as Provincial Commander of the Province of Isabela from 19881989, as Commander of Cebu Metropolitan District Command (Metrodiscom) from 19891992, and as Provincial Director of the Province of Laguna from February to July 1992. He was then appointed to the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission as Chief of the Task Force Habagat from 1992 to 1995. From 1996 to April 1997, he was a project officer of Special Project Alpha. Lacson was appointed by then President Joseph Estrada to head the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force (PAOCTF) and to serve as Director-General of the Philippine National Police. Lacson\'s notable accomplishments were the reduction of corrupt policemen (Kotong Cops), various syndicates particularly gambling and drug cartels and punished undisciplined motorists. Lacson ran for senator in the 2001 elections under the LDP, which was affiliated with Estrada\'s Puwersa ng Masa coalition. He won a seat in the Senate, finishing in the tenth place. In late 2006, Lacson said he may run as mayor of the city of Manila in the 2007 midterm elections. However, he rescinded that decision and instead ran for re-election for a second Senate term under the Genuine Opposition coalition. He won reelection in the 2007 senatorial elections senatorial elections, ranking third. In the Senate, Lacson primarily authored the following: He was also one of the co-authors of the following laws: Lacson ran for President in the 2004 general election against the incumbent President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. His candidacy stirred disagreements with its party president, Senator Edgardo Angara. The COMELEC decided to follow what was done in the Quirino-Avelino case splitting the certificates of votes into half. Angara appealed the case before the Supreme Court and reversed the COMELEC decision. Lacson resigned from the party upon hearing the news. He continued campaigning and in the elections, he finished third, ahead of former Senator Raul Roco and Bro. Eddie Villanueva. In 1995, the PACC was linked to the killing of 11 members of Kuratong Baleleng in Quezon City. In 2003, the High Tribunal ordered the Quezon City Regional Trial Court to try the case against Lacson and 33 other police officials. The trial court however dismissed the criminal case, finding absence of probable cause. The special prosecuting team later moved for new trial before the High Tribunal to remand case to the trial court to present new evidence against Senator Lacson, inter alia. On May 2, 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines resolved to take cognizance of the motion of the families of the slain Kuratong Baleleng members for revival of the murder case against police officials and Senator Panfilo Lacson.[2] After eight years in the United States, Sabina and Carina Dacer, on July 11, 2008 testified before the Manila Regional Trial Court, regarding the mastermind of the abduction of their father. Sabina swore that: "In his exact words he said, \'mga anak, kung may mangyari sa akin, walang ibang may kakagawan noon kundi si Ping Lacson\'" (my children, if anything should happen to me, no one else could be responsible but Ping Lacson). Dacer\'s family also discovered the publicist\'s letter to Joseph Estrada on Panfilo Lacson\'s 1999 actuation to secure the Philippine National Police chief post. Dacer was the publicist of then PNP chief Roberto Lastimoso, Lacson\'s rival. Lacson\'s link to one of the suspects, Michael Ray Aquino, were also evident according to the Dacer witnesses. Lacson denied the allegations: "For the nth time, I will assert the truth that I had nothing to do with it. They can lie and make people lie even under oath and before a court of law to make me look bad and guilty in the Dacer case. In fact, right after Dacer disappeared, the family sought my help.... And I responded the way I should as a law enforcement officer at that time."[3] Former police senior superintendent Cezar Mancao also named Lacson as the mastermind of the murders of Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito. The allegations were made in an affidavit that Mancao signed on February 14, 2009, according to The Philippine Star. Mancao was allegedly present when Lacson gave the hit order to then police senior superintendent Michael Ray Aquino sometime in October 2000.[4] Lacson denied these allegations, stating that the Office of the President had pressured Mancao to sign the affidavit.[4] In an interview by Philippine Daily Inquirer, then Transportation Undersecretary Reynaldo Berroya said that Dacer possessed documents showing Lacson was earning billions of pesos from stock manipulation.[5] Berroya was chief of the Philippine National Police Intelligence Group at the time of the murders. Dacer and Corbito were abducted the morning of November 24, 2000, while on their way to the Manila Hotel. Investigations later showed that the two were interrogated, tortured and strangled to death, and their bodies burned.[5] Mancao has recently returned to the Philippines on June 5, 2009, which is now in custody of the National Bureau of Investigation. On the same day, Panfilo Lacson told the press that he will no longer seek the Presidency in 2010 citing the cost of campaigning.[6] He left the Philippines on January 5, 2010 to Hong Kong, shortly before charges against him were filed in court and his whereabouts for the next year were unknown. On February 5, 2010, the Regional Trial Court in Manila issued an arrest warrant against him. On February 12, 2010, Interpol issued an international notice for Lacson. On February 3, 2011, the Court of Appeals withdrew the murder charges against the senator. Its decision cited Mancao as "not a credible and trustworthy witness".[7] He returned to the country on March 26, 2011.

aS'Civil War is an early strategic board wargame, produced by Avalon Hill, in 1961. Designed by Wargaming Hall of Fame designer Charles S. Roberts, it was issued to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the American Civil War, along with the tactical games Gettysburg and Chancellorsville. The game included a heavy cardstock game board, a rules sheet, advertisements for other AH games, and a pamphlet on the historical setting. There were two cardboard trays with sixteen blue plastic pawns, nine red pawns and one six-sided die. The game board displays the eastern part of the United States from Missouri to Pennsylvania and eastern Texas at the top to northern Florida on the lower half. The map itself is white, with blue rivers, black railroads, brown rough terrain, and various cities and ports. Six of the blue Union army pawns begin on the board, as well as six of the red Confederate States Army pawns. Reinforcements arrive much faster for the Union, with a total of fifteen pawns eventually in play versus nine for the Confederates. Each game turn represents a month of time (1861 through 1865). Only one pawn may occupy a square at a time, and all pawns may move 1 or 2 hexes per turn, plus a bonus of 8 hexes if using the railroads. Union pawns may move 8 hexes via rivers or the sea, while the Confederate pawns may only use rivers (and only get 2 hexes for that movement). All, any or none of the pawns may move each turn. Combat is resolved using a combat results table found on the gameboard. Certain terrain features double the defensive benefit. The goal is to capture or dispute control of reinforcement centers.'

aS"kubo Tadazane ( ?, January 15, 1782  April 4, 1837) was the 7th daimy of Odawara Domain in Sagami Province, (modern-day Kanagawa Prefecture) in mid-Edo period Japan. His courtesy title was Kaga no Kami. Tadazane was born in Edo in 1782 (some sources state 1778) as the son of the 6th daimy of Odawara, kubo Tadaaki. He succeeded to headship of the kubo clan and Odawara Domain upon his fathers death in 1796. During his tenure, he reformed the domain's faltering finances, particularly through his employment of the scholar Ninomiya Sontoku, who reformed the domain's taxes and encouraged development of agriculture through immigation from other domains. In 1800, Tadazane had his start in the Tokugawa administration as a Sshaban, or Master of Ceremonies. Four years later, on January 28, 1804, he was appointed to the concurrent position of Jisha-bugy (Magistrate of Temples and Shrines). On June 25, 1810 he became Osaka Castellan, followed by the post of Kyoto Shoshidai from April 16, 1815. As was usually the case with holders of the latter office, Tadazane became a Rj under Shogun Tokugawa Ienari upon the completion of his duties in 1818 (having been recommended by Matsudaira Sadanobu). He died 19 years later, while still holding the office of Rj, in 1837. His grave is at the clan temple of Saisho-ji in Setagaya, Tokyo. Tadazane was married to a daughter of Hachisuka Haruaki, daimy of Tokushima Domain, but his only son and heir kubu Tadanaga died in 1831. He adopted Tadanagas son, Tadanao as his heir."

aS'Ashton Hall is a largely rebuilt 14th-century mansion in the civil parish of Thurnham, Lancashire, England. It is 3 miles (4.8km) south of the city of Lancaster and is on the east bank of the River Lune[1]. It has been designated a GradeI listed building by English Heritage and is now owned by Lancashire Golf Club. In the 13th century the lordship of the Manor was held by the De Coucy family and from them passed to John de Coupland. The original hall dates from the late 14th century. It was probably completed in 1381, built by Edmund Lawrence.[2] It then passed by marriage to the Butlers of Radcliffe and from them to the Gerards of Bromley. In 1698 the estate was acquired by James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Hamilton, on his second marriage to the Gerard heiress Elizabeth Gerard. He fought a famous duel in 1712 with Lord Mohun over the right of ownership of Gawthorpe Hall and was fatally stabbed by General Macartney, Mohun\'s second. His widow lived for another 32 years, spending most of her time at the Hall.[3] In 1853, the hall was sold by the Dukes of Hamilton to Le Gendre Nicholas Starkie of the wealthy Starkie family of Huntroyde Hall and in 1856 was largely rebuilt to a design by William Le Gendre Starkie.[2] The only part of the 14th century structure that still remains is the tower that now forms the southern wing of the hall.[1] After Le Gendre Starkie\'s death Ashton passed to his younger son, John Piers Chamberlain Starkie who passed it in turn to his eldest son Edward Arthur Le Gendre Starkie. He sold it in 1884 to James Williamson, the linoleum manufacturer, who lived at the hall until his death in 1930. Williamson was High Sheriff of Lancashire for 1885 and on his elevation to the peerage took his title Baron Ashton of Ashton. After his death in 1931 the major portion of the estate was purchased by William Pye and his sons.[4] The land around Ashton Hall has been turned into a golf course, and the hall is now owned by Lancaster Golf Club.[2] Ashton Hall is constructed of red and grey sandstone, with roofs of slate.[5] Its plan is unusual, with towers set diagonally.[2] The 19th-century building was built in the Gothic style of grey sandstone. The rectangular 14th-century tower is of red sandstone; it has angle-towers and a crenellated parapet.[5] The grounds of the hall have a number of other buildings. There is a sandstone ashlar gatehouse which dates from around 1600. It was extended in the 19th century. The gatehouse has a segmented arch with Doric columns.[6] An ice house of sandstone rubble and brick stands to the north-west of the hall. This probably dates from the 19th century.[7] There is a building to the west of the hall that was formerly a stable block and has been converted into a house. Dating from the 17th century, it is a two-storey building of sandstone rubble.[8] On 1 August 1952, English Heritage designated Ashton Hall a GradeI listed building.[5] The GradeI designationthe highest of the three gradesis for buildings "of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important".[9] The gatehouse and the former stable block have received separate GradeII* designations.[8][6] The ice house, an arched conduit mouth, a mounting block and the courtyard walls are listed at GradeII.[7][10][11][12][13]'

This bidentate ligand chelates metals via the two phosphine groups. Its name is derived from its description  being both chiral and a phosphine. Chiraphos is available in two enantiomeric forms, S,S and R,R, each with C2 symmetry. Chiraphos is prepared from S,S or R,R-2,3-butanediol, which are derived from commercially available S,S or R,R-tartaric acid; the technique of using cheaply available enantiopure starting materials is known as chiral pool synthesis. The diol is tosylated and then the ditosylate is treated with lithium diphenylphosphide.[1] The ligand was an important demonstration of how the conformation of the chelate ring can affect asymmetric induction by a metal catalyst. Prior to this work, in most chiral phosphines, e.g., DIPAMP, phosphorus was the stereogenic center. '

aS'Kasshabog Lake is a small lake in the southern part of the Canadian province of Ontario. It is home to a cottage community, including game fishing, a marina and lodges. Kasshabog Lake is located 22km (14mi) north of Havelock in Havelock-Belmont-Methuen Township. The lake receives flow from several smaller tributary lakes. The major inflow is from the North River which is part of the Crowe Lake system. Although the lake has many islands and bays, only MacDonald (Bills) Bay appeared to be hydrologically separated from the main lake. In 1978, the lake had 16 permanent residences, 504 cottages, and four cottage rental units. MacDonald Bay has 81 cottages along its shoreline. The volume of water in MacDonald Bay flushes itself about twice during the year, while the rest of the lake flushes only about once a year. Kasshabog Lake has soft, slightly acidic water with a moderately low amount of apparent colour. The hardness, alkalinity, and conductivity levels indicate the lake is well mixed. Thermal stratification (temperature layers) were found in almost all the bays and monitoring stations. Water clarity was moderately good throughout the lake, and the secchi disk results indicate the lake is mesotrophic, or moderately enriched. Dissolved oxygen distribution throughout the lake showed a gradual decline with increasing depth, probably due to the decomposition of organic matter in the bottom waters. No significant accumulations of nutrients in the bottom waters was found at any of the monitoring stations. The density and composition of the phytoplankton (microscopic water plants) indicated an unenriched lake condition. The density and composition of the zookplankton (microscopic animals) indicated moderately enriched lake conditions. The most popular sportfish of Kasshabog lake are Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Smallmouth Bass. The lake also contains Rock Bass, Perch, and Walleye (Pickerel). There was a tornado in the summer of 2002, it was most likely anEF0 or EF1. There was tree damage and a few houses damaged.

The report concludes that: "Unimin is the source of contaminants that are being released to the atmosphere in an amount and manner that is causing the following adverse effects, contrary to the general provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, RSO 1990 (EPA), Section 14: a)impairment of the quality of the natural environment for any use that can be made of it, b) damage to property, c)harm or material discomfort to any person, d)loss of enjoyment of normal use of property. The Facility operations are the source of contaminants whose observed deposition results in violations of the limits contained in schedule 2 of Ontario Regulation 419?05 (Local Air Quality) for Dustfall. Unimin is the source of contaminants that are being released to the atmosphere in an amount and manner that is in violation of Part III, section 45 of Ontario REgulation 419/05 (Local Air Quality).".[2] Residents of the lake have also issued formal complaints to the mine, Ministry of the Environment and the Environmental Commissioner regarding sound emissions from the mine.[3] Their complaints and observations contradict the findings by Pinchin Environmental for Unimin. That report concluded that "the noise impacts from both plants at the monitoring locations were below the applicable MOE guideline limites for Class 3 (Rural) areas".[4]'

aS"wxWidgets (formerly wxWindows) is a widget toolkit and tools library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for cross-platform applications. wxWidgets enables a program's GUI code to compile and run on several computer platforms with minimal or no code changes. It covers systems such as Microsoft Windows, OS X (Carbon and Cocoa), iOS (Cocoa Touch), Linux/Unix (X11, Motif, and GTK+), OpenVMS, OS/2 and AmigaOS. A version for embedded systems is under development.[2] wxWidgets is used across many industry sectors, most notably by Xerox, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Lockheed Martin, NASA and the Center for Naval Analyses. It is also used in the public sector and education by, for example, Dartmouth Medical School, National Human Genome Research Institute, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and many others.[3] wxWidgets is used in many open source projects,[4] and by individual developers. A wide choice of compilers and other tools to use with wxWidgets, allows development of highly sophisticated applications on a tight budget.[3] It is free and open source software, distributed under the terms of the wxWidgets License, which satisfies those who wish to produce for GPL and proprietary software.[5] wxWidgets (initially wxWindows) was started in 1992 by Julian Smart at the University of Edinburgh.[6] He attained an honours degree in Computational science from the University of St Andrews in 1986, and is still a core developer.[7][8] On February 20, 2004, the developers of wxWindows announced that the project was changing its name to wxWidgets, as a result of Microsoft requesting Julian Smart to respect Microsoft's United Kingdom trademark of the term Windows.[9] Major release versions were 2.4 on 6 January 2003, 2.6 on 21 April 2005 and 2.8.0 on 14 December 2006. wxWidgets has participated in the Google Summer of Code since 2006.[10][11] The following table contains the release history of wxWidgets, showing all of its major release versions. wxWidgets is distributed under a custom made wxWindows License, similar to the GNU Lesser General Public License, with an exception stating that derived works in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This license is a free software license, making wxWidgets free software.[5] It has been approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).[17] wxWidgets is supported on the following platforms.[18] wxWidgets is officially confirmed to work properly with the following compilers.[20] The wxWidgets library is implemented in C++, with bindings available for many commonly used programming languages. Some of them:[21] wxWidgets is best described as a native mode toolkit as it provides a thin abstraction to a platform's native widgets, contrary to emulating the display of widgets using graphic primitives. Calling a native widget on the target platform results in a more native looking interface than toolkits such as Swing (for Java), as well as offering performance and other benefits.[39] The toolkit is also not restricted to GUI development, having an inter-process communication layer, socket networking functionality, and more. There are many Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools available, among them:[40][41] Notable applications that use wxWidgets:"

aS'Radioisotope heater units (RHU) are small devices that provide heat through radioactive decay. They are similar to tiny radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) and normally provide about one watt of heat each, derived from the decay of a few grams of Plutonium-238although other radioactive isotopes could be used. The heat produced by these RHUs is given off continuously for several decades and, theoretically, for up to a century or more.[1] In spacecraft, RHUs are necessary to heat critical components and subsystems. RHUs also reduce spacecraft complexity by making heater subsystems unnecessary. By having as few heating subsystems as possible, the overall complexity of the spacecraft can be reduced.[1] While both RHUs and RTGs use the decay heat of a radioactive isotope (usually Pu-238), RHUs are generally much smaller as a result of omitting the thermocouples and heat sinks/radiators required to generate electricity from heat. Both RHUs and RTGs feature rugged, heat-resistant casings to safely contain the radioisotope in the event of a launch vehicle failure or an accidental collision with the earth from deep space. The total mass of a single RHU (including shielding) is about 40grams. Similar schemes, such as thermo-ionic generators, have also been used. Most lunar and Martian surface probes use RHUs for heat, including many probes that use solar panels rather than RTGs to generate electricity. Examples include the seismometer deployed on the Moon by Apollo 11 in 1969, which contained 1.2ounces (34 grams) of Plutonium-238; Mars Pathfinder; and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. RHUs are especially useful on the Moon because of its lengthy and cold two-week night. Virtually every deep space mission beyond Mars uses both RHUs and RTGs. Solar insolation decreases with the square of the distance from the Sun, so additional heat is needed to keep spacecraft components at nominal operating temperature. Some of this heat is produced electrically because it is easier to control, but electrical heaters are far less efficient than a RHU because RTGs convert only a few percent of their heat to electricity and reject the rest to space. The CassiniHuygens spacecraft at Saturn contains eighty-two of these units (in addition to three main RTGs for power generation). The associated Huygens probe contains thirty-five. The United States Department of Energy has developed the General Purpose Heat Source (GPHS) primarily for space use. These GPHSes can be used individually or in groups of up to eighteen for component heating and sources for RTGs. Each GPHS contains four iridium-clad Pu-238 fuel pellets, standing 5cm tall, 10cm square and weighs 1.44kg.'

aS'Boat Sharing describes the ownership of boats, mainly sailing boats, by a non-profit organisation for its members, for pleasure use. A boat sharing organisation may be an association, club, cooperative or company. The boats may be owned by the organisation, or leased to it, with members hiring or booking the boats for use for a variety of cruise durations. The costs of setting up, financing and administering a boat sharing scheme may be offset by the eventual higher utilisation of the boats and moorings, producing cheaper rates of sailing for its members compared to private boat ownership. Members joining a boat sharing scheme may also save themselves the need to wait for a mooring, which in many marinas can be significant due to the demand exceeding supply. Advocates of boat sharing contend that it offers a fairer way of utilising over-subscribed but sometimes under-used moorings. Larger sharing schemes may also offer the opportunity to members of sailing from different ports and shores, and with different classes of boat. The limiting factor for the growth of a boat sharing organisation is still, as for the private owner, the availability of moorings.'

aS'Fixed Bayonets! (1951) is a war film written and directed by Samuel Fuller and produced by Twentieth Century-Fox during the Korean War. It is Fuller\'s second film about the Korean War. In his motion picture debut, James Dean appears briefly at the conclusion of the film. The film is set in the first winter of the Korean War during the Red Chinese intervention . The story follows the fate of a lone 48 man platoon left as a rear guard to defend a choke point, to cover the withdrawal of their division over an exposed bridge. The subplot explores the psychological makeup of the individuals charged with leadership of the platoon, and therein examines the nature of service and valor. Ultimately command of the platoon falls upon Cpl. Denno (Richard Basehart), who has an innate aversion to responsibility for the lives of others. Roy Webb composed the film\'s score using two songs. Music by James F. Hanley\nLyrics by Ballard MacDonald Fixed Bayonets! was the first film of a seven picture deal between Twentieth Century-Fox and writer/director Fuller. Fox had been impressed with Fuller\'s The Steel Helmet and sought to better the imitations of that film on the then topical subject of the Korean War.[2] Having had problems with Fuller\'s The Steel Helmet, The U.S. Army assigned Medal of Honor recipient Raymond Harvey as the film\'s technical advisor. Samuel Fuller, himself a decorated World War II veteran, forged a bond with Harvey which endured; Harvey again served as technical adviser in the 1958 film Verboten!. Fixed Bayonets! is also noteworthy as the first appearance, albeit uncredited, of James Dean in a feature film. Though an original story, Darryl F. Zanuck thought the story of the reluctant Richard Basehart\'s unwillingness to take command was reminiscent of Fox\'s Immortal Sergeant and Fox ordered a screen credit for the writer of that film.[3] Fuller relates that with the large number of action films made during the time, the film had trouble getting some extras for the opening retreat scene. A production assistant was able to find some dancers from a musical and after costuming, Fuller had them convincingly simulate fatigue and depression by loading their uniforms and packs with heavy weights.[4] Though the US 1st Infantry Division did not serve in Korea, Fuller names his General and Regimental Commander after his the men he served under in "The Big Red One" Terry de la Mesa Allen, Sr. and George A. Taylor as well as making the Regiments the ones of the Division in World War II, the 16th, 18th and 26th. General Lesley McNair is also mentioned.

aS'The Malaysian Insider (also known as TMI, The Insider, or \'Malay Ins Ins\') is a bilingual news site popular in Malaysia. It has been consistently ranked as one of the 100 most popular websites in the country with a strong following in Singapore. Alexa ranked The Insider as the 57th most popular website in Malaysia in June 2009.[1] Compete.com estimated that almost 19,000 unique visitors visited the website in April 2009.[2] The Malaysian Insider was established by the Png Hong Kwang and Sreedhar Subramanian. Png is a journalist while Subramaniam is the former chief operating officer of the free-to-air Malaysian television channel ntv7. It is now led by the chief executive officer and editor Jahabar Sadiq, who has worked as a journalist in Malaysia and the region since 1988.[3] TMI was started in December 2007 by a group of businessmen and journalists close to then Prime Minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi as a counter balance against MalaysiaKini, which was deemed to be unfriendly to the Barisan Nasional (BN). But after Abdullah stepped down in 2009, the group stopped the financing and the TMI top management, after talking to several people, eventually got funding with help from a 30-something Penang-born businessman with close ties to the current BN leadership.[4] The Insider aims to report "unvarnished take on events and personalities in Malaysia".[3] The editorial generally maintains a critical stance against both Barisan Nasional and Pakatan Rakyat, although it has lately leaned more towards Pakatan Rakyat. During the 2009 Perak constitutional crisis in which Barisan Nasional managed to topple the Pakatan Rakyat state government, frequent hard-hitting editorial pieces calling for the dissolution of the state assembly were published. While the news site runs multiple sections from business to entertainment, political news and commentaries dominate attention. The organization houses a group of reporters who produce the bulk of its leading domestic new news content. To complement the in-house reporters, The Insider reproduces syndicated material from other established mainstream news organizations like Bernama, Reuters and Associated Press. The Insider maintains a large roster of columnists from diverse background. Nevertheless, the majority of the columnists do not share the same political positions as Barisan Nasional. Several of the more notable columnists are the member of the Selangor state assemblyman and political secretary to the Selangor Menteri Besar Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad, DAP Member of Parliament Liew Chin Tong, PAS MP Khalid Abdul Samad, UMNO MP Nur Jazlan Mohamed and a former Special Officer to Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Ziad Razak.[5] Apart from the regular columnists, The Insider publishes letters from readers as well as blog entries.[6] In 2009, The Insider published two books. Both compiled selected writings of its columnists. UMNO accused The Insider of biased reporting. The party barred The Insider as well as several online news organizations from covering its general assembly held in Kuala Lumpur in 2009.[7]'

aS'A Red Flag Warning also known as a Fire Weather Warning is a forecast warning issued by the United States National Weather Service to inform area firefighting and land management agencies that conditions are ideal for wildland fire ignition, and rapid propagation. After drought conditions, and when humidity is very low, and especially when high or erratic winds which may include lightning are a factor, the Red Flag Warning becomes a critical statement for firefighting agencies. These agencies often alter their staffing and equipment resources dramatically to accommodate the forecast risk. To the public, a Red Flag Warning means high fire danger with increased probability of a quickly spreading vegetation fire in the area within 24 hours. The weather criteria for fire weather watches and red flag warnings vary with each Weather Service Offices warning area based on the local vegetation type, topography, and distance from major water sources. They usually include the daily vegetation moisture content calculations, expected afternoon high temperature, afternoon minimum relative humidity and daytime wind speed. Outdoor burning bans may also be proclaimed by local law and fire agencies based on Red Flag Warnings. A separate but less imminent forecast may include a Fire Weather Watch, which is issued to alert fire and land management agencies to the possibility that Red Flag conditions may exist beyond the first forecast period (12 hours). The watch is issued generally 12 to 48 hours in advance of the expected conditions, but can be issued up to 72 hours in advance if the NWS agency is reasonably confident. The term Fire Weather Watch is headlined in the routine forecast and issued as a product. That watch then remains in effect until it expires, is canceled, or upgraded to a Red Flag Warning.

aS'Hybrid institutions have emerged in response to the increasingly complex problems faced by contemporary society, problems that transcend geographic boundaries and political sectors. Hybrid institutions are symptomatic of the move to governance in recent decades; the process of governing has evolved from being almost entirely nation state driven to include various non-state actors such as NGOs, the private sector, and civil society. The term hybrid institution is not yet well-established or clearly defined in academic literature. This article therefore begins by offering a definition of the term and a brief discussion of its origins. The article thereafter is structured as a series of examples which demonstrate some of the key characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of hybrid institutions. These examples are mostly limited to environmental issues, and have been selected for their value in introducing the concept of hybrid institutions, in that they encapsulate key themes. There remains a multitude of other examples, and contributions from both environmental and other fields are welcomed and encouraged. The term institution eludes precise definition, and its interpretation in academic literature varies. The dictionary definition: an established law, custom, or practice[1] is an oft-used and useful starting point. Theoretical discussions have highlighted a distinction between formal (laws, official rules, contracts, standards, procedures) and informal (shared values, behavioural norms, belief systems, codes of conduct, discourses) institutions.[2][3][4] This distinction has emerged from what has been termed the new institutionalism,[5] which adopts a more critical approach to the study of institutions. Institutions are seen as key actors in guiding the political process, and are shaped by historical struggles, rules and procedures; rather than being merely the aggregation of individual motives. The apparent paradox at play here,[6] that institutions both shape political processes and are themselves the product of political processes, is explored further in the examples below. The new institutionalism is of value in defining what constitutes a hybrid institution, as it demonstrates a concern with new arrangements for policy-making rather than a new look at old institutions.[7] Lowdnes concept of the disaggregated institution theorises the institutionalisation of relations between governmental and non-governmental actors,[8] providing a useful starting point for conceptualising hybrid institutions. A hybrid institution is as an institution which exists between or across the boundaries of sectors, government departments, geographic units, or combines the governance regimes of traditional dichotomies such as the state and the market.[9] They represent a new institutional pluralism, blurring the boundaries between previously distinct policy entities by creating new formal and informal institutions. A definition which includes both formal and informal institutions may be considered problematic in that almost any dialogue or cooperation could be considered an informal hybrid institution. Norths distinction between loosely and thickly institutionalised policy environments is of use here.[10] Where cooperation is limited, and not enshrined within official documents or a specific policy or contract (loose, informal institutionalisation), the hybrid can be said to be weak. Within thickly institutionalised environments, with contracts, rules, joint appointments etc. the hybrid is strong. This distinction is examined further in examples below. Depending on the specific context, a strong or weak hybridisation may determine the legitimacy of the institution. Institutional theorists stress the need to distinguish between institutions and organisations. Organisations are defined as purposive entities,[11] and are tangible things[12] which have remits, offices and staff.[13] Institutions on the other hand provide the rules, norms and settings within which organisations emerged. With hybrid institutions, such a distinction may be more difficult to draw, or perhaps not so necessary. If two existing organisations collaborate to form a joint department, bureau or agency, this new tangible entity may meet the criteria of an organisation, but given its novelty and the specific conditions of its formation (being the result of an explicitly collaborative or hybrid approach), it may be considered a hybrid institution. Treating organisation and institution synonymously is perhaps less problematic within the context of hybrid institutions. Hybrid institutions, although rarely discussed explicitly in the literature, have existed since the 1980s. The quangos established under the Thatcher Government, for instance, represent state-market institutional hybrids. Quangos also serve to demonstrate the neoliberal context within which the changes in institutional configurations are taking place (the rolling back of the state and a more prominent role for the market). Moreover the IPCC and its predecessor the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases (considered below), hybrids operating between science and politics, were first established over two decades ago. The term itself was coined by administrative economist Oliver Williamson. His original use of the term to analyse modes of governance in the private sector conflates nicely with ideas of hybrid governance more generally. Williamson explored hierarchal governance within the firm, and (self)governance of single transaction markets.[14] Williamsons examination of the efficacy of hybrid modes of governance which combine the responsiveness, efficiency and low transaction costs of markets with the administrative and cooperative capacity within the firm resembles state-market hybrids to some extent. Type II Partnerships were developed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. These partnerships exemplify a more general shift in governance practice that has been termed The Partnership Movement,[15] whereby transnational governance networks [...] bring together public, private and societal actors in an effort to institutionalise a set of ideas, practices, and norms[16] (emphasis added). There are clear links with network governance here, which studies the relationships between different (usually non-state) actors that work together on a particular issue or policy. The Type II Partnerships can be seen as an attempt to promote hybrid institutions between public and private actors. Whether or not these policy networks and partnerships were institutionalised, or were genuine hybrids, is debated within the literature. This debate provides a useful indirect critique of hybrid institutions. Although Type II Partnerships were conceived as public-private hybrids, the private sector is involved in just 20% of partnerships, and takes the lead in only 2%.[17] Most partnerships are led by government agencies, NGOs, or existing international organisations, and the vast majority of funding comes from governments. Moreover, only 6% of partnerships involve actors from all the major categories set out: rich countries, poor countries, international organisations, NGOs, and industry. Thus, Type IIs should perhaps be considered state-non-state, rather than public-private hybrid institutions, if they can be considered hybrid institutions at all. Because they develop out of existing institutional arrangements, hybrid institutions may be seen as reinforcing existing power structures,[18] serving as a reinvention of existing institutions,[19] which do not help address key institutional deficits in areas with the greatest need. This is another prominent criticism in literature on partnerships. Existing organisations seek legitimacy through successful initiatives and thus target areas which already enjoy a reasonable level of institutional capacity to boost their chances of success, meaning that weaker states and marginalised areas where the need for governance solutions is greatest are left out of the process.[20] This is rather perverse for an initiative geared toward sustainable development. Although the partnerships have been criticised, a common criticism both of the Type IIs and multilateral policy more generally is the minimal degree of institutionalisation[21] seen. This serves to promote strong hybrid institutions as a potential solution to the low implementation record of [...] multilateral partnerships.[22] One of the more successful partnerships, The Andean Biotrade Programme, demonstrates both genuine hybridity and strongly institutionalised outcomes. The governments of 5 Andean countries, rich donor states, local and international organisations, research institutions and local communities all came together to form a Regional Biodiversity Strategy. The Strategy contains agreements on biotrade, technological development for conservation and eco-finance, a set of intersected [issues] that have been deadlocked at the governmental level by competing interests and power inequalities.[23] In the context of the Type II Partnerships, strong hybrid institutionalisation is indicative of, indeed a precondition[24] for success. By the same token, weak, informal institutionalism which demonstrates only cosmetic or symbolic[25] arrangements does not bear positive results. Strong institutionalisation of partnerships in the form of monitoring procedures or implementation reviews, as well as helping ensure positive outcomes (legitimacy), also helps address a key requirement for institutions, accountability. New hybrid forms of governance make achieving accountability more difficult. Traditionally, (democratic) states are accountable to their voters, and private organisations to their members and shareholders. However, when numerous organisations act together, the picture is more complex. States are still ultimately acting on behalf of their citizens, but when acting in tandem with other sectors, or at the global level, the traditional lines of accountability[26] lengthen. Moreover, there is often external accountability as well as internal, in that actors are accountable to the people in areas they affect as well as their own constituents and members. By having clear and transparent strategies, policy documents, and reporting procedures, hybrid institutions can ensure their legitimacy and accountability. The IPCC is both a scientific and a political institution. It consists of over 2000 scientists representing 154 countries, and was conceived as an explicitly hybrid institution capable of producing a political consensus around scientific knowledge concerning the global climate[27] (emphasis added). The success of the IPCC in establishing political consensus over a very complex issue, and the failings of its predecessor, the Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases, again serve as a useful indication of the principles for success in hybrid institutions. The IPCC, in its present form, is in many ways an exemplar hybrid institution. The institutional set-up is designed to achieve consensus and buy-in on a very complex issue. Each chapter must have a lead author from both the global north and south, to help ensure the report reflects the perspectives of both developed and developing countries. The final report must be unanimously agreed upon by both scientists and government representatives, resulting in a document which is policy relevant but not policy prescriptive.[28] As with the partnerships discussed previously, the importance of achieving both a balance of input from different sectors, and rules which shape outcomes is evident; demonstrating need for strong, genuinely hybrid institutions. Equally, some of the failings of the IPCC in its early forms, and its predecessor, demonstrate the failings of imbalanced hybrids. The quota rule which requires both north and south inputs for each chapter was introduced in response to criticism that the reports were western-centric.[29] Moreover, Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases failed because it was too far removed from policy-making process. Without sufficient dialogue with policy-makers, the Advisory Group was viewed with suspicion for its lack of transparency and openness.[30] In this instance the Group failed to balance between scientific and political process and thus failed as a hybrid. Some critics have argued that the IPCC produces watered-down recommendations, because of the extent of political consultation. However, as illustrated, the political dialogue is necessary and has seen remarkable success in establishing consensus. A further criticism of the IPCC is that its formation was shaped by a northern political agenda,[31] and by framing climate change in terms of tolerable levels, the moral and political issues over differential historical uses of the worlds resources were avoided. This argument reflects a wider critique of institutions as being the product of traditional power structures that perpetuate existing inequalities.[32] Solutions that rest on hybrid institutions would be rejected by scholars such as Jordan & ORiordan who argue for a universal shift[33] in the institutional arrangements for tackling climate change, as they serve to promote western interests at the expense of the developing world at present. Dolly the sheep was born on 7 February 1997 as the first animal cloned from adult cells. The institutional arrangements behind this scientific feat demonstrate the increasing embeddedness[34] of political, scientific, and economic processes at work in the production of knowledge. Dolly was a product of three intimately linked institutions: The Roslin Research Institute (government funded), PPL Therapeutics (private firm), and Edinburgh University. Formally, these are all separate entities, but in reality they are intertwined and should be considered hybrid institutions.[35] PPL, whose involvement in funding the Dolly project was driven by potential commercial applications, was originally a spin-off from the Roslin Institute. The Roslin institute was initially formed to take advantage of the strong biomedical department at Edinburgh University, and over 50 PhD students from the University were involved in the Dolly project. Such hybrid arrangements are increasingly important, the hybridity that these institutes represent[36] subverts views of a linear relationship between science and policy and demonstrates the required intellectual pluralism and flexibility[37] in public science systems . Again, the neoliberal context is evident here, with state-funded entities having to engage with the private sector and demonstrate economic worthiness to maintain legitimacy. In previous examples, successful institutions are defined by strong hybridity. However, hybridity which is too strong can challenge the legitimacy of academic-scientific-private hybrids. Gulbrandsen highlights the dilemma faced by Research Institutions in their engagement with the private sector and universities. Stockholm syndrome, whereby hostages develop loyalty to their captors, is used to describe a scenario where the need for private funding jeopardises the neutrality of the research process in favour of a particular clients perspective. Lima syndrome, whereby the captors develop an attachment to their hostages, applies where research bodies lose sight of their role in contributing to society and becoming preoccupied with esoteric academic debates.[38] This example shows that an implied relationship between success and strong hybridity does not apply in all contexts. Indeed, weak and informally institutionalised hybrids may be necessary to retain legitimacy in some cases. One of the few uses of the term hybrid institutions in academic literature which relates explicitly to governance is German & Keelers discussion of hybridising governance of property regimes.[39] Ostroms theory of common pool resource management highlights the value of community-created institutions in the governing of a common resource[40] (communication, rule-making, sanctions, conflict resolution etc.). German & Keelers proposal is to extrapolate these successful principles and apply them across diverse property regimes,[41] for state-owned, private and communal resources, creating hybrid institutions that combine usually distinct governance regimes. The proposal is that the combining technical and enforcement capacity of the state, the legal certainty of ownership, and the successful principles of self-organisation may help govern responses where property regimes are contentious or overlap, or where issues exist that do not respect discrete regimes of resource tenure (for example pests, weeds, or watercourse pollution). This proposal argues for hybridity not between two sectors or organisations, but between previously distinct institutional configurations associated with separate modes of governance: "[T]he functioning of [these] hybrid institutions depends upon the creative combination of autonomous (market), self-organising (contractual) and state regulatory (hierarchical) approaches to governance[42] (emphasis added) As outlined previously, hybrid institutions are becoming more prominent amid moves away from traditional government towards modes of governance more appropriate for complex issues. For instance, a great deal of political faith is being placed on hybrid institutions for tackling climate change in the form of carbon markets. Carbon markets are very much hybrid institutions in that they rely on governments to set the rules for participation,[43] such as setting the cap or baseline, monitoring, verification and, as seen in the recently announced Australian carbon tax, setting a minimum price for carbon.[44] Only once carbon markets have been crafted[45] by political decisions does the market aspect enter into play. The complexity and hybridity of the institutional set-up of carbon markers will be further increased if proposals to link carbon markets from different regions of the world come to fruition. Another proposal concerns the creation of a new, hybrid institution to better manage the overlaps between the UN Climate Regime and the WTO in areas such as border taxes on environmentally damaging goods, transfer of clean technologies, and trade liberalisation;[46] institutionalising joint consideration of climate change and development. Currently these issues are addressed by the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE), however there are questions as to whether this is sufficient. Even the IPCC (which avoids prescriptive policy advice) has questioned whether the CTE is an appropriate forum[47] for such discussions. Hybrid institutions then, have the potential to bring together expertise, [...] and broaden dialogues to overcome negotiation deadlocks.[48] Legitimacy and accountability of these relatively novel arrangements rests upon establishing the right degree of institutionalisation and balanced hybridity, both of which vary within different contexts.'

aS'The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions is a four-disc box set of music recordings by trumpeter Miles Davis. The set collects all tracks Davis recorded between August 19, 1969 and February 6, 1970, including the 1970 double album Bitches Brew in its entirety. However, the title of the box set is somewhat of a misnomer: outside of the Bitches Brew tracks themselves, none of the other tracks were recorded during the same August 1969 sessions that resulted in Bitches Brew. Furthermore, additional material recorded for, but not used in Bitches Brew (mainly rehearsal takes and unedited performances of the six album tracks), is not included in this set (though they later appeared on bootleg recordings titled Deep Brew Vol. 1 and Vol. 2). When questioned by Paul Tingen why most of the material in fact was not recorded either for or at the same sessions as the original album, re-issue producer Bob Belden clarified how the team\'s thought process went. According to him and the engineer, all the songs Miles Davis recorded between August 1969 and early February 1970 used very similar line-ups to those on Bitches Brew, and the main thing they all had in common was the emphasis on keyboards. Every song in the set includes two to three keyboard players, most often Chick Corea, Joe Zawinul and Herbie Hancock. It wasn\'t until late February 1970 that Davis refined his concept by dropping the multiple electric pianists for a more guitar-heavy sound. Those following sessions were collected on The Complete Jack Johnson Sessions. The box set includes some tracks that had never been previously released, one of which, the Wayne Shorter composition "Feio," has since appeared as a bonus track on late compact disc reissues of Bitches Brew. A few of the other tracks in the box set had previously appeared on the albums Live-Evil, Big Fun, and Circle in the Round. The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions is chronologically number "6" in a series of Miles Davis box sets issued by Columbia Records/Legacy Records/Sony Music (the numbering scheme refers to the chronological order of the original recordings, not the release order of the box sets themselves).

aS"Leyton Orient (1937-present) Brisbane Road, currently referred to as the Matchroom Stadium for sponsorship purposes and originally known as Osborne Road, is a football stadium in Brisbane Road, Leyton, east London, England. It has been the home ground of Leyton Orient since 1937, prior to which it was the home of amateur football team Leyton F.C., who moved to the Hare and Hounds ground. The highest attendance at the ground was 34,345 for the visit of West Ham United in the 1964 FA Cup. It has hosted a number of England U-16 and England womens team matches in the past. It hosted the 200708 FA Women's Premier League Cup final. It is also home of the Tottenham Hotspur Reserves. Brisbane Road will host the final of the NextGen series.[1] Brisbane Road has seen several developments in its history, but due to the Second World War the first major improvement was the levelling of a grass bank and crash barrier installation in 1949. The terracing behind the goals was improved again in 1952, 1959 and 1960. In 1956 a small seated stand was dismantled and replaced with a stand from the decrepit Mitcham Stadium, which held 2,600 fans. In 1962, with Leyton Orient gaining promotion to the First Division, another wing was added to the main stand making the seating total 3,500. In 1978 the West Stand was converted into all-seating. In 1996 the terracing at the southern end of the ground was demolished, and used as a car park while Lottery funding to build a stand was (unsuccessfully) sought. The South Stand was eventually built in 1999, and was renamed The Tommy Johnston Stand on 5 September 2008.[2] The ground is named after Leyton Orient chairman Barry Hearn's sports promotion company, Matchroom Sport, prior to which it was officially the Leyton Stadium, though fans still refer to it as Brisbane Road. The club registered an interest into moving into the Olympic Stadium following the 2012 Olympics, as the original plan was for this to have a capacity of about 25,000; however, the club's average attendance of about 5,000 meant that this was in no way a probable move. The eventual bids from both West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur to move into the Stadium,[3] with capacity nearer 60,000, effectively ended Orient's interest. Brisbane Road is in very close proximity to both the Olympic Park and also Hackney Marshes. On 6 May 2012, Brisbane Road hosted a Super League game between London Broncos and Bradford Bulls due to works on the Broncos home stadium Twickenham Stoop, with Bradford winning 29-22. Capacity: 2,918 The West Stand is the new main stand[4] at Brisbane Road and currently seats home supporters only. It has a capacity of 2,918 (also 23 disabled supporters + 23 helpers). The letters L O F C are marked into the seats in black. It is also home to the club's offices, and the club superstore and ticket office are at the back of this stand. There is also a row of executive seating (the Directors' Balcony) above the main seating which overhangs the rest of the stand, and the Olympic Suite which offers corporate hospitality. This stand also has premium seating (with its own bar) in its centre, known as the Gallery. It has two refreshment outlets at either end underneath the stand and it is accessed by turnstiles at either end via Oliver Road, or via the main reception for Gallery members and Olympic Suite diners. The players' changing rooms are also located underneath this stand and players emerge from the tunnel here. The dugouts are also located at the front of this stand after being moved from the opposite East Stand for the start of the 2006-07 season. Capacity: 3,636 The East Stand, previously the main stand, is the oldest stand at Brisbane Road and is used by both home and away supporters. When an away team is allocated the entire stand for safety or other reasons, Orient fans in the North half of the stand are required to move elsewhere to accommodate the extra away fans. The capacity of the Northern end of this stand is 2,133 and the Southern end is 1,459. There are also executive seats in the middle of the stand (the old directors' box, now known as the Wyvern Suite) but these are not ordinarily used by any supporters. Capacity: 1,381 The recently built North Stand was completed for the start of the 2007-08 season and is currently used as a family stand. It replaces a former open terrace. It has a capacity of 1,351 plus provision for 15 disabled supporters and 15 helpers, and has the letters L O F C marked into the seats in black. Access to this stand is by turnstiles at each end of the stand and there are two refreshment outlets located underneath the stand. Capacity: 1,336 This stand was built in 1999 and was formerly called the South Stand. It was renamed in 2008 in memory of Leyton Orient's record goalscorer Tommy Johnston. It is currently for home supporters only and has a capacity of 1,336. It has a refreshment outlet and a bar underneath the stand and is accessed through turnstiles from Buckingham Road. It has the word ORIENT marked into the seats in white. A large block of flats backs on to the stand. Coordinates: 513336.54N 0045.57W / 51.5601500N 0.0126583W / 51.5601500; -0.0126583"

aS'Gustav von Myrdacz (born 12 July 1874 in Vienna; died 11 July 1945 in Tirana) was an Austrian noble who was instrumental in organising the Royal Albanian Army from the early 1920s to 1945. Gustav von Myrdacz was born in Vienna on 11 July 1874 to a German-speaking Roman Catholic Silesian noble family. His father, Paul von Myrdacz (4 May 1847 - 7 July 1930), was born in Konsk (Tinec) and pursued a career as a military doctor in the Austria-Hungary army. Little is known of his mother Emma Zettl. As such Dr Paul von Myrdacz had been involved in the occupation of Bosnia in 1878 and spent some time there in the 1880s. Gustav von Myrdacz grew up in the multi-lingual, multi-cultural environment of the late Hapsburg empire and trained to become a military engineer. He attended high school in Vienna and the Theresian Military Academy (Theresianischen Militrakademie) in Wiener Neustadt and in 1897 was posted to the Hapsburg Austrian Military Police Battalion Number 32 in Galicia. Over 1901-03 he attended the military school of the General Staff College (Kriegsschule der Generalstabsakademie) and served in various infantry brigades as a staff officer after 1904. From 1909 he was a tactical instructor at the technical military academy (Technischen Militrakademie ) in Mdling. When World War I began in 1914 von Myrdacz served as an officer in Sarajevo. In December 1915 he was attached to the General Division of the XIX. Corps under General Ignaz von Trollmann. Here he helped Austria conquer and occupy Serbia and enter northern Albania to engage Italian soldiers. From 1 May 1917 Gustav von Myrdacz commanded the border guard battalion IV (Grenzjgerbataillon IV), before becoming the chief of staff to the 14th Infantry Division assigned to the Italian front. Here he participated in the Battles of the Isonzo. In 1918, partly because of his involvement in the occupation of Albania, Gustav von Myrdacz was introduced to a young honorary Colonel named Ahmed Zog in Vienna.[1] On 5 January 1918 Gustav von Myrdacz was appointed Colonel in the General Staff Corps (Oberst im Generalstabskorps). From 16 July 1918 he commanded the last offensive of Austria-Hungary in Venetia when he led Infantry Regiment No. 117 on the Tonale Pass in Tyrol. A day after the armistice he was captured and became a prisoner of war in Italy. He was discharged after one year. Returning to republican Austria Gustav von Myrdacz was appointed commander at the State Office of Styria. He was then posted to Graz (where his father had retired) to become Stellvertretender Stadtkommandant (Deputy Militia Commandant). In 1920 Gustav von Myrdacz retired from service in Austria at the rank of Brigadier-General and joined the newly formed Albanian army at the invitation of Ahmed Zog. Three years later he accepted a commission to become Chief of Staff. He joined a group of foreign nationals advising the Albanian government under Ahmed Zog including Leon Ghilardi from Dalmatia, and Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Francis Stirling and Major-General Sir Jocelyn Percy from Britain. Most of his duties, beyond training officers and small military formations in basic manoeuvres, involved building "military" roads. "He was a quiet bespectacled man, who resembled more an academic than a soldier. From the first, he recommended that Albania needed only a very small standing army..As his savings would not go far in Austria, he stayed on the [Albanian] army payroll, while devoting much of his time to music and gardening."[2] In 1928 the new Fascist regime in Italy tried to increase influence and power within Albania, and General Alberto Pariani was sent as a military "advisor". The Albanian Prime Minister Ahmed Zog sidestepped the Italian Military Mission and appointed himself as Chief of General Staff. (The following year he made himself King of Albania). Colonel Gustav von Myrdacz was immediately entrusted with the same post in the "new" Royal Albanian Army. It suited Zog and the Albanians to have their army trained by a man who had fought against the Italians. As for von Myrdacz: "The efforts of General Pariani to convert the Albanian army into a modern fighting force evoked his wry amusement."[3] When Fascist Italy invaded Albania in April 1939, King Zog fled but many of von Myrdacz\'s officers and trained soldiers fought back. When the Royal Albanian Army was dissolved Gustav von Myrdacz lost his job but chose to stay on in Tirana with his wife Ida (Ne Heller-Fiedler). "Chief among his problems was an acerbic wife, unhappy at the prospect of living out her days in Tirana."[4] After the occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany in September 1943 German troops crossed into Albania and Gustav von Myrdacz was partially employed by the new regime to restore law and order. Officially the German regime employed him "as liaison officer between the Albanian army and the Twenty-first Army Corps".[5] He was also involved in recruiting some men and officers for the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg (1st Albanian) in 1944 but his exact role remains nebulous. Abaz Kupi knew him and hoped to obtain ammunition to fight the partisans. In September 1944 SS Standartenfhrer Josef Fitzthum (a fellow Austrian) directly appointed a three man "control committee" for Tirana including two obscure Albanians and General Gustav von Myrdacz. The following month the German evacuated Tirana. It is believed the Communist partisans of Enver Hoxha (a failed schoolteacher) captured him and executed the elderly General in 1945, probably in January.[6]'

Even when he was studying in the eighth class he was attracted towards poetry. In his early work life he had a clerk\'s job in the municipal office in Simla, where he toiled up to 1942. During that period, he read eastern and western authors extensively and wrote poetry. He expresses his indebtedness to the Urdu poetry of Firaq Gorakhpuri and Ahsan Danish, as well as to the Hindi poems of Pant and Nirala.In those days the newspapers in the Delhi-Punjab brought out special supplements and held poetry contests to mark Krishna Janmashtami, in which he participated regularly.He was attracted towards poetry during his school days. In the mid-1940s, Krishan shifted to Mumbai to become a screenwriter. His first screenplay was Janta (1947). His first film as a lyricist was Zanjeer (1947). He was first noted for the script and lyrics of the Motilal-Suraiya starrer Aaj Ki Rat (1948).[1] After the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, Krishan wrote a song Suno Suno Aye Duniyawalon, Bapu Ki Yeh Amar Kahani. The song was sung by Mohammed Rafi and composed by Husnlal Bhagatram, and was a great hit. He also tasted success as a lyricist with the films Badi Bahen (1949) and Lahore (1949). Rajendra Krishan knew Tamil language and wrote 18 scripts for AVM Studios films.[1] Rajendra Krishna is known for his association with the composer C.

After his death, HMV brought out an LP containing 12 of his songs.[1] Rajendra Krishan was considered the richest writer in Hindi cinema. The reason was that he had won a jackpot worth Rs.46,00,000 in horse racing. The sum was considered a huge amount during the late seventies.[citation needed] Rajendra Krishan won Filmfare Award for best lyricist for the movie Khandan (1965) for the song "Tumhi mere mandir, tumhi meri pooja".'

aS'Banding is a medical procedure which uses elastic bands for constriction. Banding may be used to tie off blood vessels in order to stop bleeding, as in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices.[1] The band restricts blood flow to the ligated tissue, so that it eventually dies and sloughs away from the supporting tissue. This same principle underlies banding as treatment for hemorrhoids.[2] Banding may also be used to restrict the function of an organ without killing it. In gastric banding to treat obesity,[3] the size of the stomach is reduced so that digestion is slowed and the patient feels full more quickly. '

aS'This article is part of the series:\nPoliticsandgovernment\noftheEuropeanUnion A regulation is a legislative act of the European Union[1] that becomes immediately enforceable as law in all member states simultaneously.[2][3] Regulations can be distinguished from directives which, at least in principle, need to be transposed into national law. Regulations can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter. The legal basis for the enactment of regulations is Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 249 TEC). The Council can delegate legislative authority to the Commission and, depending on the area and the appropriate legislative procedure, both institutions can make laws.[2] There are Council regulations and Commission regulations. Article 288 does not clearly distinguish between legislative acts and administrative acts, as is normally done in national legal systems.[3] Regulations are in some sense equivalent to "Acts of Parliament", in the sense that what they say is law and they do not need to be mediated into national law by means of implementing measures. As such, regulations constitute one of the most powerful forms of European Union law and a great deal of care is required in their drafting and formulation. When a regulation comes into force, it overrides all national laws dealing with the same subject matter and subsequent national legislation must be consistent with and made in the light of the regulation. While member states are prohibited from obscuring the direct effect of regulations, it is common practice to pass legislation dealing with consequential matters arising from the coming into force of a regulation.'

aS'The Bonang is a musical instrument used in the Javanese gamelan. It is a collection of small gongs (sometimes called "kettles" or "pots") placed horizontally onto strings in a wooden frame (rancak), either one or two rows wide. All of the kettles have a central boss, but around it the lower-pitched ones have a flattened head, while the higher ones have an arched one. Each is tuned to a specific pitch in the appropriate scale; thus there are different bonang for pelog and slendro. They are typically hit with padded sticks (tabuh). This is similar to the other cradled gongs in the gamelan, the kethuk, kempyang, and kenong. Bonang may be made of forged bronze, welded and cold-hammered iron, or a combination of metals. In addition to the gong-shaped form of kettles, economical bonang made of hammered iron or brass plates with raised bosses are often found in village gamelan, in Suriname-style gamelan, and in some American gamelan. In central Javanese gamelan there are three types of bonang used: The parts played by the bonang barung and bonang panerus are more complex than many instruments in the gamelan; thus, it is generally considered an elaborating instrument. Sometimes it plays melodies based on the balungan, though generally modified in a simple way. However, it can also play more complex patterns, obtained by combining barung and panerus patters, such as the alternation of interlocking parts (imbal) and the interpolation of florid melodic patterns (sekaran). A single, l-shaped, row, bonang (kolenang) is also a leading melodic instrument in the Sundanese Gamelan degung. The bonang is similar to the Balinese reong and the single row kulintang of the southern Philippines and Borneo.'

aS'Keuka Lake (/kjuk/ KEW-k)[2] is an unusual member of the U.S. state of New York\'s Finger Lakes because it is Y-shaped, instead of long and narrow. Because of its shape, it was referred to in the past as Crooked Lake. Keuka means "canoe landing" in the Iroquois language and "lake with an elbow" in the Seneca language.[3] Keuka Lake empties into another Finger Lake, Seneca Lake, from a stream, called Keuka Lake Outlet, at the lake\'s northeastern end in Penn Yan, New York. The stream empties into Seneca Lake at the village of Dresden. At one time the outlet was developed into a canal, the Crooked Lake Canal, connecting the lakes. This canal was later replaced by a railroad branch line which is now a hiking and cycling trail. The lake is about 20 miles (32km) long and varies in width from a half mile to two miles (13km). The length of the shoreline is about 60 miles (96km). It has a surface area of 11,730 acres (47km), and a maximum and mean depth of 186 feet (57 m) and 101 feet (31 m) respectively. This body of water possesses large and healthy populations of lake trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and yellow perch. The productive fishery is supported by huge numbers of baitfish, most notably alewives (sawbellies), and is a very popular lake with area fishermen. The village of Penn Yan, New York is at the northeastern tip of the lake, and Branchport is at the northwestern tip. Hammondsport lies at the south end of the lake. Hammondsport was the home of Glenn Curtiss, a pioneer of naval aviation, and is now the site of the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum. While the shore of the lake is primarily residential, Keuka College is located in Keuka Park on the western shore of the east branch and Keuka Lake State Park is located on the eastern side of the northwest branch of the lake. YMCA Camp Cory is located on the eastern side of the northeast branch of the lake. Camp Good Days and Special Times is located on the western side of the northwest branch of the lake. An important component of the economy of this region is based on grape growing and wine production and vineyards cover some areas sloping down to the lake. Humans, fish, and wildlife depend on the rich ecology of the lake habitat. The complex ecosystem is subject to contamination of the watershed, largely by storm water runoff. The Keuka Lake Association (KLA) monitors the water of the lake to ensure that it is suitable for its many uses, such as drinking, fishing, and swimming. Tributary streams, groundwater, and the lake itself are regularly tested for water quality. Additionally, KLA collects and publishes data about the lake level. The infestation of European Zebra Mussels, which has impacted many North American bodies of water, has also affected Keuka Lake and other Finger Lakes in New York. In addition to disrupting the lake\'s ecosystem, Zebra Mussels can be a nuisance to lakeside homeowners. Their small size enables them to clog water intake pipes.[4][5] Furthermore, their sharp shells can cause lacerations on the feet of bathers. Bathers may wish to wear water shoes when swimming in the lake. List of vineyards included in the Keuka Lake Wine Trail:'

aS'The Duquesne Class were the first class of post Washington Treaty heavy cruisers built for the French Navy. They have been criticised by naval architects for having very little armour and being lightly built. However, they were considered to be good steamers and seaworthy vessels which could maintain a full speed for protracted time periods. Both ships survived World War II having seen little combat since they were part of the French squadron "demilitarized" in Alexandria harbor from 1940 through mid-1943. After rejoining the Allies, both were refitted in the U.S., landing their catapults and aircraft, having the mainmast suppressed and being given an augmented anti-aircraft armamment of 8 x 40mm.

aS"These are the official results of the Men's Long Jump event at the 1991 IAAF World Championships in Tokyo, Japan. There were a total number of 43 participating athletes, with two qualifying groups and the final held on Friday August 30, 1991. This was perhaps the greatest long jump competition as both of the top two athletes were credited with distances beyond the existing world record that had stood for almost 23 years. Both (now retired) jumped the best jumps of their careers in this competition, the top two measured jumps in history, the number one and number three best wind-legal jumps in history, the best two not aided by altitude. Lewis' record at the time was; a two time Olympic Gold medalist, two time World Champion and was considered the best long jumper in the world having been undefeated in ten years. Lewis had set the World Record in the 100 metres 5 days earlier. Lewis was in the lead through four rounds, his first round jump set the championship record, then his third round jump setting his personal wind-legal record. Powell's fourth round jump looked like it was in the range of Lewis, but was ruled a foul, the closeness of the call upset Powell. Powell went down to his knees at the board trying to see the microscopic indentation into the plasticine indicating it was a foul. Lewis' fourth round jump was wind-aided, but beat the existing world record and to that moment was the longest measured jump in history. Powell's wind legal fifth round jump topped that, setting the world record. But the competition was not over. Moments later Lewis answered with his lifetime wind-legal personal record. Both athletes still had one jump remaining. While Powell fouled and then prayed, Lewis made his second best wind-legal jump. Thus the competition included the best three wind-legal attempts of Lewis' career, plus a wind-aided attempt beyond the existing world record that he had chased for ten years and he still finished in second place. Since this competition, no athlete, including Powell and Lewis has jumped within 20cm of Powell's world record. This momentous event achieved another unique occurrence. It was the only time American network television, in this case NBC, devoted over 20 minutes to a single field event competition. See the video in four parts: Part 1 the introduction, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4. Prior to this competition, the existing world and Championship records were as follows. "

aS'Pathophysiology is a convergence of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state, whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Pathology describes the abnormal or undesired condition, whereupon pathophysiology seeks to explain the physiological processes or mechanisms whereby such condition develops and progresses. Pathophysiology can also mean the functional changes associated with or resulting from disease or injury.[1] In Germany in the 1830s, Johannes Mller led the establishment of physiology research autonomous from medical research. In 1843, the Berlin Physical Society was founded in part to purge biology and medicine of vitalism, and in 1847 Hermann von Helmholtz, who joined the Society in 1845, published the paper "On the conservation of energy", highly influential to reduce physiology\'s research foundation to physical sciences. In the late 1850s, German anatomical pathologist Rudolph Virchow, a former student of Mller, directed focus to the cell, establishing cytology as the focus of physiological research, while Julius Cohnheim pioneered experimental pathology in medical schools\' scientific laboratories. pandu pj By 1863, motivated by Louis Pasteur\'s report on fermentation to butyric acid, fellow Frenchman Casimir Davaine identified a microorganism as the crucial causal agent of the cattle disease anthrax, but its routinely vanishing from blood left other scientists inferring it a mere byproduct of putrefaction.[2] In 1876, upon Ferdinand Cohn\'s report of a tiny spore stage of a bacterial species, the fellow German Robert Koch isolated Davaine\'s bacterides in pure culturea pivotal step that would establish bacteriology as a distinct disciplineidentified a spore stage, applied Jakob Henle\'s postulates, and confirmed Davaine\'s conclusion, a major feat for experimental pathology. Pasteur and colleagues followed up with ecological investigations confirming its role in the natural environment via spores in soil. Also, as to septicemia, Davaine had injected rabbits with a highly diluted, tiny amount of putrid blood, duplicated disease, and used the term ferment of putrefaction, but it was unclear whether this referred as did Pasteur\'s term ferment to a microorganism or, as it did for many others, to a chemical.[3] In 1878, Koch published Aetiology of Traumatic Infective Diseases, unlike any previous work, where in 80 pages Koch, as noted by an historian, "was able to show, in a manner practically conclusive, that a number of diseases, differing clinically, anatomically, and in aetiology, can be produced experimentally by the injection of putrid materials into animals."[3] Koch used bacteriology and the new staining methods with aniline dyes to identify particular microorganisms for each.[3] Germ theory of disease crystallized the concept of etiologya disease\'s specific causationpresumably identifiable by scientific investigation.[4] The American physician William Welch trained in German pathology from 1876 to 1878, including under Cohnheim, and opened America\'s first scientific laboratorya pathology laboratoryat Bellevue Hospital in New York City in 1878.[5] Welch\'s course drew enrollment from students at other medical schools, which responded by opening their own pathology laboratories.[5] Once appointed by Daniel Coit Gilman, upon advice by John Shaw Billings, as founding dean of the medical school of the newly forming Johns Hopkins University that Gilman, as its first president, was planning, Welch traveled again to Germany for training in Koch\'s bacteriology in 1883.[5] Welch returned to America but moved to Baltimore, eager to overhaul American medicine, while blending Vichow\'s anatomical pathology, Cohnheim\'s experimental pathology, and Koch\'s bacteriology.[6] Hopkins medical school, led by the "Four Horsemen"Welch, William Osler, Howard Kelly, and William Halstedopened at last in 1893 as America\'s first medical school devoted to teaching German scientific medicine, so called.[5] The first biomedical institutes, Pasteur Institute and Berlin Institute for Infectious Diseases, whose first directors were Pasteur and Koch, were founded in 1888 and 1891, respectively. America\'s first biomedical institute, The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, was founded in 1901 with Welch, nicknamed "dean of American medicine", as its scientific director, who appointed his former Hopkins student Simon Flexner as director of pathology and bacteriology laboratories. By way of World War I and World War II, Rockefeller Institute became the globe\'s leader in biomedical research. The 1918 pandemic triggered frenzied search for its cause, although most deaths were via lobar pneumonia, already attributed to pneumococcal invasion. In London, pathologist with the Ministry of Health, Fred Griffith in 1928 reported pneumococcal transformation from virulent to avirulent and between antigenic typesnearly a switch in specieschallenging pneumonia\'s specific causation.[7][8] The laboratory of Rockefeller Institute\'s Oswald Avery, America\'s leading pneumococcal expert, was so troubled by the report that they refused to attempt repetition.[9] When Avery was away on summer vacation, Martin Dawson, British-Canadian, convinced that anything from England must be correct, repeated Griffith\'s results, then achieved transformation in vitro, too, opening it to precise investigation.[9] Having returned, Avery kept a photo of Griffith on his desk while his researchers followed the trail. In 1944, Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty reported the transformation factor as DNA, widely doubted amid estimations that something must act with it.[10] At the time of Griffith\'s report, it was unrecognized that bacteria even had genes.[11] The first genetics, Mendelian genetics, began at 1900, yet inheritance of Mendelian traits was localized to chromosomes by 1903, thus chromosomal genetics. Biochemistry emerged in the same decade.[12] In the 1940s, most scientists viewed the cell as a "sack of chemicals"a membrane containing only loose molecules in chaotic motionand the only especial cell structures as chromosomes, which bacteria lack as such.[12] Chromosomal DNA was presumed too simple, so genes were sought in chromosomal proteins. Yet in 1953, American biologist James Watson and British physicist Francis Crick inferred DNA\'s molecular structurea double helixand conjectured it to spell a code. In the early 1960s, Crick helped crack a genetic code in DNA, thus establishing molecular genetics. In the late 1930s, Rockefeller Foundation had spearheaded and funded the molecular biology research programseeking fundamental explanation of organisms and lifeled largely by physicist Max Delbrck at Caltech and Vanderbilt University.[13] Yet the reality of organelles in cells was controversial amid unclear visualization with conventional light microscopy.[12] Around 1940, largely via cancer research at Rockefeller Institute, cell biology emerged as a new discipline filling the vast gap between cytology and biochemistry by applying new technologyultracentrifuge and electron microscopeto identify and deconstruct cell structures, functions, and mechanisms.[12] The two new sciences interlaced, cell and molecular biology.[12] Mindful of Griffith and Avery, Joshua Lederberg confirmed bacterial conjugationreported decades earlier but controversialand was awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[14] At Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island, New York, Delbrck and Salvador Luria led the Phage Grouphosting Watsondiscovering details of cell physiology by tracking changes to bacteria upon infection with their viruses, the process transduction. Lederberg led the opening of a genetics department at Stanford University\'s medical school, and facilitated greater communication between biologists and medical departments.[14] In the 1950s, researches on rheumatic fever, a complication of streptococcal infections, revealed it was mediated by the host\'s own immune response, stirring investigation by pathologist Lewis Thomas that led to identification of enzymes released by the innate immune cells macrophages and that degrade host tissue.[15] In the late 1970s, as president of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, Thomas collaborated with Lederberg, soon to become president of Rockefeller University, to redirect the funding focus of the US National Institutes of Health toward basic research into the mechanisms operating during disease processes, which at the time medical scientists were all but wholly ignorant of, as biologists had scarcely taken interest in disease mechanisms.[16] Thomas became for American basic researchers a patron saint.[17] Pathophysiology is a required area of study for nearly all healthcare professional school programs (medical, dental, physician assistant, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nurse practitioner, pharmacy, nursing, and paramedic programs) in the United States, Canada and other countries.'

aS'The Javan spitting cobra (Naja sputatrix) also called the Indonesian cobra, is a stocky and highly venomous species of spitting cobra native to Indonesia. Naja sputatrix was first described by German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1827. The generic name Naja is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word ng () meaning "cobra". The specific epithet sputatrix is the feminine version of sputator, which is Latin for "spitter".[3] The Javan spitting cobra is a medium to large, heavy-bodied species which, like other cobras, has long cervical ribs capable of expanding to form a hood when threatened. The body of this species is compressed dorsoventrally and subcylindrical posteriorly. The average length of this species of cobra is approximately 1.3m (4.3ft), but they may grow to a maximum of about 1.85m (6.1ft). The head is elliptical, depressed, slightly distinct from the neck with a short, rounded snout and large nostrils. Its eyes are moderate in size with round pupils. Dorsal scales are smooth and strongly oblique. Dorsal scale count is usually 25-19.[4] Some colouration and pattern differences occur between Javan specimens and those from the other islands where this species occurs. Javan adults are usually uniform yellowish, brown or blackish in colour, while juveniles often have throat bands and lateral throat spots. Specimens do not always have hood marks, but when there is a mark, it is most often chevron-shaped.[5] [6] This species of cobra is native to the Indonesian islands of Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Flores, Lomblen, and Alor. They may possibly occur in the other islands in the group. Verification is still required as to whether or not this species of cobra also occurs in the islands of Timor and Sulawesi. Although a single specimen was observed in the island of Sulawesi, it is thought that the specimen may have originated from the island of Java, as it was indistinguishable from Javan specimens.[7][8] Scientist De Hass did research on this species in two districts of western Java: in Nandjoeng Djaja, where it was relatively uncommon and in Bandjarwangi, where the altitude is 900 metres (3,000ft), it was not recorded. A 1998 study by FB Yuwono found the species was abundant in Java.[8] The Javan spitting cobra is found mostly in tropical forests and wet forest, but the species adapts incredibly well to a wide variety of habitats across its range on the islands, including more arid regions,[4] dry woodlands, and cultivated hill country.[7] In the island of Komodo, it has been observed in a variety of habitats including dry savanna and deciduous monsoon forest.[8] It is also been reported that specimens in the island of Komodo are reluctant to spit, but field observations and suggests the opposite. This species is easy prey for the Komodo dragon.[7] Naja sputatrix is very defensive and readily spits out venom when it feels threatened. It is a terrestrial snake that\'s nocturnal in nature. It preys predominantly on small mammals such as small rats and mice, but it will also feed on frogs, other snakes,[4] and lizards. Herpetologist Shine Boeadi, in a study published in 1998, measured and dissected 80 Javan specimens of this species and found that most prey items were mammals.[8] Mating occurs during the dry season (August to October). Females often lay eggs at the end of the dry season in November or the very beginning of the wet season. As many as 13 to 19 eggs may be laid in a clutch,[7] the average is about 16 eggs. Javan females may produce and lay up to 36 eggs, but on average only 25 eggs are produced. The incubation period is about 88 days according to Kopstein.[8] Like other elapids, hatchlings are completely independent from birth. This species is listed as Appendix II by CITES meaning this species is not threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild. They are commonly harvested for their skins. They are also occasionally found in the pet trade.[9] The most significant constituents of the venom include high-molecular-weight proteins and enzymes, phospholipase A2 enzymes, postsynaptic neurotoxins and polypeptide cardiotoxins, meaning although the venom may be potent, but it may not be particularly rapid-acting.[10] Like all cobra species, this species\' venom also consists of postsynaptic neurotoxins.[4] However, the main components of its venom are cardiotoxins with cytotoxic activity.[11] In fact, polypeptide cardiotoxins make up 60% of the venom (dry weight), while postsynaptic neurotoxins make up only 4.5%. The two main neurotoxins, sputa-neurotoxin 1 (SN1) and sputa-neurotoxin 2 (SN2) isolated from the venom, are "short" neurotoxins, with 62 and 61 amino acid residues, respectively. The IV LD50 of the two toxins are 0.09 mg/g and 0.07 mg/g, respectively, and they possess amino acid sequences similar to those of other cobra venom neurotoxins.[10] The venom was also found to exhibit an in vitro anticoagulant activity much stronger than most common cobra (genus Naja) venoms. The anticoagulants, phospholipase A2 enzymes, with a molecular weight of approximately 14 kDa, make up 15% of the venom (dry weight).[10][12] Very few human fatalities are attributed to this species.[7]'

aS"Thomas Truax (pronounced troo-aks) is an American songwriter, performer, and inventor of experimental musical instruments[1] currently[when?] residing in London, England. He first came to prominence as a solo performer in the 1990s in New York as one of a group of musicians and songwriters (including Lach, Jeff Lewis, Curtis Eller, The Burning Hell, Dibs, Boo Hoo and Beck) who made up the antifolk movement based around the Sidewalk Cafe on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Truax's emergence as a solo act came after years of fronting bands (most notably Like Wow).[2] The move was in part to remove the need to rely on other people to perform and to embark in a new direction that would distinguish his act from the hundreds of bands and singer-songwriters active in New York. This new direction involved the construction and playing of unique instruments, as well as more traditional singer-songwriter style songs. The 'inventor' side of his musical act drew on his work as an animator on MTV's Celebrity Death Match and a fascination since early childhood with building objects out of whatever materials he had available. Thomas's use of 'primitive' technology, the often fantastical elements of his songs and gothic overtones (his website talks of his instruments 'as though plucked straight from the mind of Tim Burton') have led to him being linked to the subgenre of steampunk. Truax's first two instruments were the Cadillac Beatspinner Wheel and the Hornicator, the former being a system of spinning wheels, metal spokes and small cymbals, which, through the use of various contact mics, 'beats out' through the PA a primitive drum beat that forms the backing to songs that Thomas then plays on guitar. Its large size made the Beatspinner Wheel unsuitable for touring, so Truax created a smaller version, entitled 'Sister Spinster' that he uses to this day. The Hornicator started life as an old gramophone record horn, before Truax added a set of strings, a kazoo and a microphone. Here Thomas beats out the rhythm on the horn's metal casing (using a ringed finger to create a 'click' and other fingers to create a contrastive 'thud') which is then repeated through the use of a looper pedal that records the beat and loops it over the PA, allowing Thomas to add more layers of other instrumentation (through the strings and other implements attached to the Hornicator). Finally Thomas sings a vocal through a microphone attached to the instrument. Other instruments work as variations on automatic rhythms and looped beats: the Stringaling features a vaguely bongo-like drum at the top of a length of clothes' drier tubing to which is attached a variety of musical devices with pull-strings; Mary Poppins features a metal column attached to which are two arms that fly out to the side and spin, creating a train-like rhythm; the Backbeater, made up of several rotating spokes, straps on to Thomas' back and spins to create a low rhythm. Some songs do not feature any of his inventions, most notably 'Inside the Internet' which is played solely on guitar, and 'The Butterfly & The Entomologist', which is again played on a guitar, albeit with the use of a pocket fan that Thomas uses to hit the strings to produce an eerie effect. Common themes in Thomas's songs include love, loneliness, travel, the animal kingdom, nature and technology.[3] Truax was once challenged to show how he makes an instrument. Given many items retrieved from a recycle bin, within 15 minutes he created a rhythmic invention which he looped through effects with water and rubber bands.[4] Though Truax usually only performs solo, his records contain songs with full band arrangements, along with his invented instruments. He has been featured in several music documentaries including Adam Clitheroe's 'One Man In The Band' (2008) and Gabriel Shalom's 'Instrumental'(2005).[5] Compilation Tracks:"

aS'The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to solar energy: Solar energy radiant light and heat from the sun. It has been harnessed by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include solar heating, solar photovoltaics, solar thermal electricity and solar architecture, which can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces. Solar energy can be described as all of the following: Solar power the conversion of sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP). Solar thermal energy (STE) technology for harnessing solar energy for thermal energy (heat). Concentrated solar power a system that uses mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight, or solar thermal energy, onto a small area. Electrical power is produced when the concentrated light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (usually a steam turbine) connected to an electrical power generator.

aS'Andrew K is a Greek DJ and record producer, born in Thessaloniki, Greece. He has performed in numerous clubs and festivals worldwide. As a producer, he has more than 50 releases, on various labels, including Global Underground, Vapour Recordings, Baroque, Armada, Anjunabeats. He also runs his own digital label, Vise Versa Music, focusing on progressive and tech house.[1][2][3] Andrew K\'s interest in music had him study piano and music theory. His hobbies include international music and collecting records have been amongst his first hobbies. His first attempts as a DJ were at friends birthday parties and small underground private raves. He subsequently began composing and producing his own tracks. This caught the attention of DJ Leoni who later signed Andrew to Underground Lessons Recordings (ULR) label. Acting as management, UL set him up with his first professional gigs, as well as having him join Leoni on his weekly radio show.[1] Furthermore, ULR signed and released Inception EP: a collaborative effort with Simon Oates under the moniker of Junk Science. The EP was supported by a variety of international DJs and was aired at many Greek and internet radio stations.[1][2] In a 2004 competition held by Global DJ Broadcast, Andrew made it into the top 10 ranking for "New Yalent DJs" when his music set selected from among hundreds of entries worldwide. Following the competition, his sets began being hosted on Proton Radio, Eccentic Beats, Global DJ Broadcast, Safari FM, Dance Nation and Di.fm, among others, and he began making public appearances as a DJ at events throughout Greece and abroad.[1][3] Continued work led to tracks that were signed to international labels, as for example Jataka which was intended for release on ULR, but caught the attention of Global DJ Broadcast\'s Markus Schulz, who eventually released the tracks on Armada and his compilation Coldharbour Sessions. This led to international recognition and additional labels signing Andrew for his productions and remixes, as well as well-known DJs licensing his tracks in mix compilations. As a DJ, he has many appearances worldwide, both in clubs and festivals worldwide, including the legendary Cavo Paradiso at Mykonos, Greece. [1][3] In 2007 Andrew K launched Vise Versa Music, a musical imprint bringing top quality, contemporary club music. The label has been excellently received by DJs and music fans worldwide, while some of the signed artists include Max Cooper, Robytek, Max Demand and David Granha.[1] Beat Factor gave Dj Leoni & Andrew K\'s compilation Flavours, a good review, noting "[Flavours] takes us for some good minutes through the electronic music universe, meeting in our travel all kind of musical tyles, from progressive house, break beat, through dark house and even some powerful beats with a tech-house flavour" and concluding after length "If it would be for a cd pool, I think Andrew K is the one who could gain, succeeding to bring in the front some great tracks mixed with a perfect skill".[4] Andrew K has released over 50 records in a variety of respected labels including Armada, Mo-Do, Pure Substance, Vapour Recordings, Babylon Records.[2][5]  '

aS'Anti-communist mass killings refer to the political mass murder of communists, alleged communists, other leftists, or their supporters by right-wing, reactionary regimes.[citation needed] The Dirty War refers to the state-sponsored violence against Argentine citizenry from roughly 1976 to 1983 carried out primarily by Jorge Rafael Videla\'s military government. Starting in 1976, the juntas led by Videla until 1981, and then by Roberto Viola and Leopoldo Galtieri, were responsible for the illegal arrest, torture, killing or forced disappearance of thousands of people, primarily trade unionists, students and activists. Videla\'s dictatorship referred to its systematized persecution of the Argentine citizenry as the "National Reorganization Process". Up to 30,000 people "disappeared" during this time.[1] Argentine security forces and death squads worked hand in hand with other South American dictatorships in Operation Condor. An Argentine court would later condemn the government\'s crimes as crimes against humanity and genocide.[2] The Shanghai massacre of 1927, also known as the 12 April Incident, was a large-scale purge of Communists from the Kuomintang (KMT) in Shanghai, ordered by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on 12 April 1927, during the Northern Expedition against the warlords. On 12 April 1927, Chiang carried out purge of Communists from the Kuomintang in Shanghai and began large-scale massacres. Chiang\'s forces turned machine guns on 100,000 workers taking to streets, massacring more than 5000 people. Throughout April 1927 in Shanghai, more than 12,000 people were killed. The killing in Shanghai drove most of the Communists out of the urban cities and into the rural countryside.[3] The greatest slaughter took place in the countryside. The White Terror in China took millions of lives, most of them in the rural areas.[4] In the days immediately following the 1973 Chilean coup d\'tat, the National Stadium was used as a concentration camp holding 40,000 prisoners.[5] Some of the most famous cases of "desaparecidos" are Charles Horman, a U.S. citizen who was killed during the coup itself,[6] Chilean songwriter Vctor Jara, and the October 1973 Caravan of Death (Caravana de la Muerte) where at least 70 persons were killed.[7] In the first three months following the coup, the number of suspected leftists killed or "disappeared" (desaparecidos) soon reached into the thousands.[8] Others operations included Operation Colombo, during which hundreds of left-wing activists were murdered, and Operation Condor, carried out with the security services of other Latin American dictatorships. Following Pinochet\'s defeat in the 1988 plebiscite, the 1991 Rettig Commission, a multipartisan effort from the Patricio Aylwin administration to discover the truth about the human-rights violations, listed a number of torture and detention centers (such as Colonia Dignidad, the ship Esmeralda or Vctor Jara Stadium). The report also determined that 2,279 persons were killed for political reasons. This figure included 957 who "disappeared" after arrest and 164 "victims of political violence", a figure that included police officers and others killed by left-wing extremists.[9](p1122) The Bodo League Massacre was a massacre that occurred in the summer of 1950 during the Korean War. Estimates of the death toll vary; while police records estimate around 10,000 deaths, the truth commission has said there may be more and according to Prof. Kim Dong-Choon, Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at least 100,000 people were executed for the suspicion of supporting communism.[10][dead link] In the southeastern city of Ulsan, hundreds of people were massacred by the South Korean police during the early months of the Korean War between 1950 and 1953. 407 civilians were summarily executed without trial in July and August 1950 alone. On 24 January 2008, the former President of Korea Roh Moo-hyun apologized for the mass killings. (See also the mass killings conducted against prison inmates who were suspected leftists at prisons in other cities such as[11] Busan, Masan, and Jinju.) In an attempt to suppress the revolution following the First World War, militias were formed out of demobilized WWI veterans. The Freikorps, as they were called, were meant as a replacement for the Kaiser\'s Army, which had evaporated overnight owing to desertion. The Freikorps was sent to suppress the revolution on the streets of Berlin and later invaded the Bavarian Soviet Republic.[12] Comintern journalist and Marxist, Victor Serge, estimated the number of workers who died in the repression of revolutionary developments in Germany from 1918 to 1921 at 15,000.[13][unreliable source?][dubious  discuss] Academic sources state that between 1919 and 1923 there were 354 victims directly traceable to Freikorps actions.[14] On 5 May 1919 twelve workers (most of them members of the Social Democratic Party, SPD) were arrested and killed by members of Freikorps Ltzow in Perlach near Munich, based on a tip from a local cleric saying they were communists. A memorial on Pfanzeltplatz in Munich today commemorates this atrocity.[15][16][17] German communists, socialists and trade unionists were among the earliest domestic opponents of Nazism[18] and were also among the first to be sent to concentration camps. Hitler claimed that communism was a Jewish ideology which the Nazis termed "Judeo-Bolshevism". Fear of communist agitation was used as justification for the Enabling Act of 1933, the law which gave Hitler his original dictatorial powers. Hermann Gring later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that the Nazis\' willingness to repress German communists prompted President Paul von Hindenburg and the German elite to cooperate with the Nazis. The first concentration camp was built at Dachau, in March 1933, to imprison German communists, socialists, trade unionists and others opposed to the Nazis.[19] Communists, social democrats and other political prisoners were forced to wear a red triangle. Whenever the Nazis occupied a new territory, members of communist, socialist, or anarchist groups were normally to be the first persons detained or executed. Evidence of this is found in Hitler\'s infamous Commissar Order, in which he ordered the summary execution of all political commissars captured among Soviet soldiers, as well as the execution of all Communist Party members in German held territory.[20][21] Einsatzgruppen carried out these executions in the east.[22] In 1919, an alternative government formed to replace the failed Bla Kun regime. Leading the armed wing of this new government was Admiral Mikls Horthy, one-time Admiral of the Austro-Hungarian Navy.[23] Horthy named his new force the National Army. Among the officers who answered Horthys call were ultra-nationalist soldiers who mounted a campaign of atrocities to avenge the victims of the Red Terror; to suppress any lingering loyalty to Communist principles; and to frighten the population into obedience to the new order.[24] These units, commonly known as the "White Guard," carried out a campaign of murder, torture and humiliations. Summary executions of people they suspected of Communist allegiance were common; these victims were often hanged in public places to serve as a warning to others. But the White Guards definition of who was an enemy of the state was a broad one. They also preyed upon peasants, upon the politically liberal, and very often upon Jews, who were broadly blamed for the Revolution because much of the Communist leadership had been Jewish.[24] The Indonesian killings of 196566 were a violent anti-Communist purge following an abortive coup in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. Conventional estimates of the number of people killed by the Indonesian security forces over the course of this period run at between 500,000 and 1,000,000.[25] The killings started in October 1965 in Jakarta, spread to Central and East Java and later to Bali, and smaller outbreaks occurred in parts of other islands,[26] notably Sumatra. As the Sukarno presidency began to unravel and Suharto began to assert control following the coup attempt, the PKI\'s upper national leadership was hunted and arrested with some summarily executed; the airforce in particular was a target of the purge. PKI chairman, Dipa Nusantara Aidit, had flown to Central Java in early October, and where the coup attempt had been supported by leftist officers in Yogyakarta, Salatiga, and Semarang.[27] Fellow senior PKI leader, Njoto, was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November, and First Deputy PKI Chairman, M.H. Lukman, was killed shortly after.[28] In 1963, a coup in Iraq overthrew Abd al-Karim Qasim, who five years earlier had deposed the Western-allied Hashemite Iraqi monarchy. This coup was reportedly backed by the British government and the United States Central Intelligence Agency.[29][30][31] At least 5,000 Iraqis were killed in the fighting from 810 February 1963, and in the house-to-house hunt for "communists" that immediately followed.[citation needed] Ba\'athists put the losses of their own party at around 80.[citation needed] The CIA is suspected of helping the new government, led by Abdul Salam Arif, in ridding the country of suspected communists.[32] In Spain, White Terror refers to the atrocities committed by the Nationalist movement during the Spanish Civil War and during Francisco Franco\'s dictatorship.[33] Most historians agree that the death toll of the White Terror was higher than that of the Red Terror. While most estimates of the Red Terror range from 38,000[34] to 55,000,[35] most of the estimates of the White Terror range from 150,000[36] to 200,000.[37] Concrete figures do not exist, as many Communists and Socialists fled Spain after losing the Civil War. Furthermore, the Francoist government destroyed thousands of documents relating to the White Terror[38][39][40] and tried to hide the executions of the Republicans.[41][42] Thousands of victims of the "White Terror" are buried in hundreds of unmarked common graves, more than 600 in Andalusia alone.[43] The largest common grave is that at San Rafael cemetery on the outskirts of Malaga (with perhaps more than 4,000 bodies).[44] The Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (Asociacin para la Recuperacin de la Memoria Historica or ARMH)[45] says that the number of disappeared is over 35,000.[46]'

aS'Ball High School is a public secondary school in Galveston, Texas, United States. Ball, which covers grades 9 through 12, is a part of Galveston Independent School District. Ball High School serves the cities of Galveston and Jamaica Beach and the unincorporated communities of Port Bolivar and Crystal Beach on the Bolivar Peninsula. The school mascot is the Tornado. In 1881, the citizens of Galveston, authorized by the legislative act of 1879 which specified that all cities of a certain size could initiate and maintain their own school system, organized a public school district and elected a board of trustees. Some 20 teachers were employed to teach students in grades one through seven. Prior to this time, all education in Galveston was private or parochial. In the summer of 1883, a local dry goods businessman, George Ball, communicated his intention to support the establishment of a public high school in Galveston via a brief and simple note to the Galveston City Council. It read: "If the authorities of this city will furnish appropriate and sufficient grounds centrally located, I will contribute $50,000 for the erection of a building to be permanently dedicated to the use of the public free schools of the City of Galveston...I will be pleased to carry [this proposal] into the earliest effect with the hope that it may prove useful to the community with which I have been long identified and whose future welfare I most earnestly desire." Ball\'s offer was accepted, and the cornerstone for what would become Ball High School in Galveston was laid on February 15, 1884. Contrary to custom, which places the cornerstone in the northeast corner of the building, it was placed at the southwest corner of the main portion of the building. It is a block of Dupree stone, upon the open sides of which are carved simply the words, "George Ball to the Children of Galveston." Articles placed in the cornerstone included photos of Mr. and Mrs. George Ball, autographs of the children attending public schools, the city directory, photos of the teachers, and a floor plan of Ball High School. Ball died on March 11, 1884, without seeing his gift completed. The new public high school in Galveston opened its doors to 200 pupils on October 1, 1884, with a building consisting of 12 classrooms, two offices and an auditorium, and with the motto "Best school south of St. Louis and west of the Mississippi." On March 4, 1886, the school was named in memory of its benefactor. The Class of 1887 represented the first graduating class of Ball High School. The school served students in grades eight through twelve. Early curriculum for Ball High School students included English, history, algebra, arithmetic, physical geography, Latin, civil government, trigonometry, physics, political economy, chemistry, mental philosophy and physiology. In 1890, Mrs. George Ball spent $47,000 to remodel, enlarge and beautify the building, which bore her husband\'s name. At this time, the Rotunda and Dome were added to the north front of the building. In September 1900, the great hurricane struck and Ball High School was not spared from the fury of its waves and wind. The west wall slipped; the roof blew off; plaster crumbled; windowpanes crashed; and the metal covering was stripped from the ball of the dome, showing its skeleton of steel ribs. In the storm\'s aftermath, citizens of the City of Galveston contributed and raised the $45,000 required to repair the high school and the other Galveston schools and also to pay the teacher\'s salaries. Because of the devastating loss of life and property during the storm, school attendance decreased by some 25 percent, creating an excess of teachers. Other Texas communities came to the rescue in many ways, perhaps most importantly by providing jobs to these Galveston teachers whose services were no longer needed in the island community. While Ball High School was undergoing massive repair, students reported to the campus known as the "K" school, today the site of San Jacinto Elementary School. By the fall of 1901, all classes were again held at the Ball High building. The school population had increased dramatically by 1915, and two wings were added to the building to accommodate the many students. The six new classrooms eased the overcrowding for a time, but by 1924 overcrowding was again a problem for students and faculty. The wings, added in 1915, were now extended in order to provide additional classroom space. For the next 30 years, no additions or improvements were made to the building on 21st and Ball Avenue. The main Ball High School building, remodeled and expanded still stands today and houses the home offices of the American Indemnity Company. Bill Cherry wrote in a 2004 Galveston County Daily News article that, by the 1950s, Ball High School "was not only horribly congested, but the building was in deplorable condition, the victim of years and years of deferred maintenance."[1] In 1954, the Ball High School complex moved to its new location, constructed in 1952,[2] at 41st street and Avenue O. This building cost $3.2 million and covered a four-square block area-41st to 43rd Streets and Avenue O to Avenue P. The new location received additions and renovations in 1964, 1974, 1981, 1994, 1995, 1996, 2004, and 2005.[2] In the late 1960s, Ball high merged with Central High School, the first black high school in Texas, founded in 1885. This reorganization created the need for the expansion of the high school into the former Sam Houston Junior High School facility at 4116 Avenue N-1/2, two blocks from the main high school structure, at 4115 Avenue O, to create the two-campus Ball High School. The original campus is often referred to as Ball High South, while the former Sam Houston campus was familiarly known as Ball High North. Central school became a middle school. In the late 1970s, the Central school campus became an eight grade school which served exclusively eighth grade students throughout the school district. Years later, additional remodeling of the South campus combined with reduced enrollments resulted in consolidating the high school at one facility. The North campus reverted to an elementary school, renamed for the late Charles B. Scott, a long-time Ball High School counselor. In 1968 Central High School, the high school for African-Americans, consolidated into Ball High School.[3] With the closure of Central High Ball High became a very early social experiment for complete school integration and busing. While there were rumblings in the community around the unacceptability of integration, integration worked at Ball High School. Much of the reason for integration\'s success was due to the success of the integrated athletics teams. Multiple conference and state titles were won during the early seventies and as a result the community rallied behind Ball High School quickly. Leadership on the sports teams was critical to assure that team mates stayed focused on winning and kept the black-white issue completely buried. In the mid-1970s, a state-of-the-art media center was added at Ball High South campus and air-conditioning was installed for the first time. The forty-year-old school received a major $1.5 million renovation and update in 1980. The most recent repairs, in 2004 and 2005, were made possible through school bonds which were in political standstill for seven years. In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston forced many families to move to other areas, including League City, Texas City, and La Marque. This meant an exodus of children from the Galveston ISD and into other school districts. If Hurricane Katrina evacuees and out-of-district students are excluded, Galveston ISD lost 12% of its students between the 2002-2003 school year and the 2006-2007 school year; Ball High School is affected as it is the only public high school in Galveston.[4] Students of Ball High School\'s Hurricane Story Tellers (Advanced Media Technology Class) are currently in production of a Hurricane Ike documentary entitled IKE: A DOCUMENTARY - The Story of a Torn City Rebuilt by Everyday Heroes. The film is about Galveston residents and businesses post Hurricane Ike, and how they must come together to help rebuild Galveston. The class began to film in October 2008 and is expected to finish in early May 2009. The film contains interviews and footage of Galveston mayor Lyda Ann Thomas.[16] Ball High School adopted a strict dress code starting in fall 2006.[17] The dress code as of June 2007 has been posted with no significant (if any) changes.[18] All Galveston ISD elementary and middle schools feed into Ball High School.

aS"The red-headed krait (Bungarus flaviceps), is a large venomous elapid snake with dramatic coloration. The red-headed krait can grow up to 2.1 m (6.9 ft).[3] It lives in lowland rain forest, including those on islands, but it is considered uncommon. It feeds primarily on specific snakes, probably semiaquatic and fossorial snakes. In Southeast Asia, the red-headed krait occurs in Malaysia, Thailand, and Sumatra, with a subspecies in Borneo. The venom potency is little-studied, as bites from this species are extremely rare.[4] The red-headed krait can be rarely spotted in Thailand, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Vietnam, western Malaysia, Pulau Tioman, and Indonesia (Bangka, Sumatra, Java, Billiton,[citation needed] Borneo). The subspecies B. f. baluensis is found in Malaysia (East Malaysia, Sabah).[5] Red-headed kraits inhabit the rain forests in mountain and hilly regions. They are hardly ever to be found in human habitats.[3] They are nocturnal and partially aquatic. Once thought to feed primarily on other snakes, they are known to include skinks, lizards, frogs, caecilians, small mammals, and snake eggs in their diets. Despite their intrinsic deadliness, they are not usually considered of high risk to humans in the daytime. Variously described as sluggish, lethargic, and extremely inoffensive, they often remain hidden during the day and, when disturbed, press their heads into the ground or hide them in the flattened or rolled coils of their bodies. During the night, they are active and extremely dangerous.[6] It presents a very striking and distinctive coloration  namely a bright red head and tail with a black body that includes a low-lateral narrow bluish white stripe.[7] Having large, smooth scales, the general appearance of the red-headed krait is glossy and attractive. The extremely rare snake's nature is inoffensive, and captives will generally refuse to strike until they have been subjected to prolonged teasing.[8] The average length of a red-headed krait is 4 to 5 ft (1.21.5 m), with a maximim of 7 ft (2.1 m).[9] They have short, hollow fangs on their maxillary bones, with inlets at the bases and outlets near their tips. The venom is ducted to the inlet and forced through the hole at the tip of the fang.[10] Bungarus flaviceps is an extremely venomous snake. Krait venom appears to function primarily as a neurotoxin, preventing communication across neuromuscular synapses and in paralysis and death by asphyxiation because the victims can no longer breath on their own.[6] When the venom from the red-headed krait takes effect, the most highly innervated muscles are the first to suffer: the muscle that elevates the upper eyelid and the ocular and ciliary muscles controlling the lens. Between 20minutes and several hours after being bitten, the victim may have a real struggle to keep his or her eyelids open, with other common manifestations being vomiting, blurred vision, headache, and hypersalivation. Then, the symptoms of paralysis may worsen, with progressive involvement of various muscles, including those of the jaws, in some cases, become locked. Respiratory distress may occur as a result of paralysis of the diaphragm, the main muscle controlling breathing.[10] Its venom also contains a novel postsynaptic neurotoxin, termed -flavitoxin, which is a potent inhibitor of nicotinic transmission in autonomic ganglia.[7] Neurotoxic symptoms may resolve naturally, or more rapidly through administration of antivenin or drugs that inactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which naturally destroys the chemical messenger carrying siganls from nerves to muscles at the neuromuscular synapse.[10]"

aS'First Impressions of Earth is the third album by the American indie rock band The Strokes. It was released in January 2006 (see 2006 in music), having been preceded by lead single "Juicebox" some weeks earlier. It is also the first album by The Strokes to have a Parental Advisory Label. The album was recorded over a ten-month period. The Strokes initially set out to record it with Gordon Raphael, the producer of their first two albums. Later on, guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. introduced them to Grammy Award-winning producer David Kahne (Paul McCartney, Tony Bennett, Sublime), who stepped in to collaborate with Raphael. However, the collaboration was not working out and so Raphael stepped down. As a result, the majority of the album was produced by Kahne.  All songs written by Julian Casablancas, except where noted.[1] The album has a score of 69 out of 100 from Metacritic based on 38 reviews indicating "generally favorable reviews".[2] Some of the reviews were among the harshest The Strokes had received up to this point in the band\'s recording career. For instance, Heather Phares of Allmusic called the album The Strokes\' "weakest album yet."[3] At the same time, the album also received positive reviews from the likes of Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly who praised the album and thought it was a marked improvement over The Strokes\' previous album Room on Fire.[6] In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention () while picking out two songs from the album ("You Only Live Once" and "Ask Me Anything") and stating, "You know how it is--the gym does more for your wind than for your jump shot."[13] Even more reviews were positive. Playlouder gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five and said, "Turns out what the world was waiting for really was those that saved guitars finally making a record that truly reaped the rewards of their efforts."[14] Punknews.org gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, "What exactly it is the Strokes ultimately hope to achieve with their music remains to be seen. However, so long as they continue to put out quality discs with high replay value, they will remain that rare breed of band where hype did not spoil the goods."[15] musicOMH gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, "For the first six songs, the whole thing is as exhilarating as Is This It?, it\'s in a different way, undoubtedly, but there\'s the same giddy rush of excitement."[16] Stylus Magazine gave it a B and called it "the first pretty good album of the year."[17] Tiny Mix Tapes also gave the album a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, "There is indeed more good than bad. Unfortunately, there is also more bad than there should be."[18] Some of the reviews are mixed or negative. Drowned in Sound gave it a score of six out of ten and stated, "Cast away the politics and the last twenty minutes and you\'ll still be left with two or three top tunes to add to your daily playlists, but it was never going to be ground-breaking or innovative."[19] Uncut gave it three stars out of five and said, "The ambition\'s hampered by Julian Casablancas\' sad-sack singing."[2] Paste also gave it a score of six out of ten and stated, "By the time they\'re through brandishing quotations, The Strokes don\'t have much of their own to say here."[20] Slant Magazine gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five and said it "introduces some subtle new colors to the band\'s musical palette... but the pervasive sense of inert boredom, which has been noted as a strength in the past, is difficult to shake."[21] PopMatters gave it a score of five stars out of ten and said, "While it might be easy to point to the industry guy behind the boards, the album speaks for itself, and the Strokes managed to write a flop all by themselves."[22] "Heart in a Cage" was the album\'s second single, followed by "You Only Live Once". NME rated First Impressions of Earth at #8 in its Albums of the Year 2006 list.[23] First Impressions of Earth entered the UK album chart at #1, The Strokes\' first one at the top spot. The album peaked at #4 in the US, with an entry sales week of 88,000 units, somewhat below the performance of its predecessors.

aS"Linked: The New Science of Networks is a popular science book written by the Hungarian physicist Albert-Lszl Barabsi and first published by the Perseus Books Group in 2002.[1] Barabsi has changed the way of thinking about real-world networks and largely contributed to making networks the revolutionary science of the 21st century. Linked is his first book that introduces the highly developing field of Network Science to the broad audience. Linked has become a bestseller with more than 70,000 copies sold after fourteen printings and it was selected as one of the Best Business Books in 2002.[2][3] The main purpose of Linked is to introduce the science of networks to the general audience. It provides an easy and readable introduction to the main models and properties of networks and their applications in many areas of real life, such as the spread of epidemics, fighting against terrorism, handling economic crises or solving social problems of the society. As the subtitle of the book says Linked reveals 'How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life'.[1] As Barabsi writes in the Introduction, Linked 'has a simple aim: to get you to think networks. It is about how networks emerge, what they look like, and how they evolve. It shows you a Web-based view of nature, society, and business, a new framework for understanding issues ranging from democracy on the Web to the vulnerability of the Internet and the spread of deadly viruses. Networks are present everywhere. All we need is an eye for them.'[1] Linked contains fifteen chapters (named links) that introduce different concepts and applications of networks: Sidney Redner, leading physicist of Boston University, describes Linked In Nature as an entertaining introductory level book of modern science. He writes His enthusiasm is apparent throughout the narrative, a feature that makes for good reading.  I would enthusiastically recommend them to my own family members. It is remarkable and gratifying to see excellent popularizations of a burgeoning field of scientific research while many developments are still in progress.[4] Ian Foster reviews Linked for Science: I found both books [Linked and Mark Buchanans Nexus] wonderfully revealing and thought provoking in terms of the broad relevance of the ideas and their future implications.[5] A review by James Brody in Human Nature Review says: Linked offers many heuristic possibilities if your interests are in genetic, neural, electronic, or social organizations. Much of the existing literature marvels at the beauty of complex organizations but doesn't take us past awe and eye candy. Yes, emergence exists but by what rules? Barabasi describes simple rules that may have tremendous power.[6] New York Times business journalist William J. Holstein says: Once you understand that concept, you're off on an intellectual detective journey. Professor Barabasi has invented a vocabulary to talk about the structure of networks.[7] Blogcritics.org writes: The joy of Albert-Lszl Barabsi's book, Linked: The New Science of Networks is that, after reading it, you can't look anywhere without seeing networks.  Buy the book. How often do you get a chance to radically alter your vision for less than $20?[8]"

aS'Lumsden is a town in the Qu\'Appelle Valley in south central Saskatchewan, Canada, 31km northwest of the city of Regina. It is surrounded by the rural municipality of Lumsden. The town functions as both a farming community and an unofficial suburb of Regina. Lumsden has an active artistic community, which consists of many writers and sculptors. Settlers first arrived in 1881 and the area came to be commonly known as Happy Hollow. When the Qu\'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway came through the community in 1889, the name was changed to Lumsden after Hugh Lumsden, a senior engineer with the railroad.[1] The town has been repeatedly flooded, with major flood events occurring in 1892, 1904, 1916, 1948, and 1969. In 1974, Lumsden experienced the highest water levels in the towns history; volunteers from Regina came to help with sandbagging. The town subsequently straightened the Qu\'Appelle Rivers channel and built dikes.[1] Major flooding occurred again in 2011 after a winter of record snowfall.[2] The community was chosen by Harrowsmith Magazine in 2002 as the "prettiest" town in the province.[3] Official town centennial celebrations were held in March 2005. In May 2005, Lumsden hosted Queen Elizabeth II and The Duke of Edinburgh at the Lumsden Sports Centre. Hundreds of guests were entertained by Marny Duncan-Cary, the Lumsden Community Choir, the Riel Reelers, and the Lumsden & District Band and Jazz Ensemble. The event was held in celebration of both the town and the province\'s centenaries, and was the only engagement of Canada\'s Queen outside urban centres on that visit to Saskatchewan.

Each year the town of Lumsden hosts a fundraiser in which thousands of labelled plastic ducks are raced down the Qu\'Appelle River. Participants purchase a numbered duck which is entered in the race, and the first ducks across the finish line win their owners cash and prizes. Proceeds from the derby benefit the sports center in town. The derby also hosts a variety of artists, musicians, traders, etc. who perform and sell their wares in town. In 2006, the Lumsden Arena became the site of the second edition of the Western Women\'s Hockey League championship, between the Calgary Oval X-Treme and the Minnesota Whitecaps.[8] The town frequently hosts games for the Saskatchewan Prairie Ice, now of the Western Women\'s Hockey League.

aS'Source: [1], 30 August 2011 William Stewart Eadie (27 November 1864  20 September 1914) was an English cricketer who played for Derbyshire between 1885 and 1899. Eadie was born in Burton-on-Trent Staffordshire, the son of James Eadie and his wife Jean. His father, who was from Scotland, had established the James Eadie brewery company at Burton in 1854.[1] Eadie made his debut for Derbyshire in the 1885 season. For the years 1887 to 1893 Eadie played over 30 matches for the club while it was without first class status. He then played first class again intermittently until the 1899 season. He was a right arm batsman who played 41 innings in 23 first class matches for Derbyshire, with a top score of 62 and an average of 10.5.[2] Eadie died at Barrow upon Trent at the age of 49. His brother, John Eadie and nephew Kenneth Dobson both played first-class cricket for Derbyshire.'

There is an isomeric form of 1,4-dioxin, 1,2-dioxin (or o-dioxin). 1,2-Dioxin is very unstable due to its peroxide-like characteristics. The term dioxin is most commonly used for a family of derivatives of dioxin, known as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs). 1,4-Dioxin can be prepared by cycloaddition, namely by the DielsAlder reaction of furan and maleic anhydride. The adduct formed has a carbon-carbon double bond, which is converted to an epoxide. The epoxide then undergoes a retro-DielsAlder reaction, forming 1,4-dioxin and regenerating maleic anhydride.[1]  The word dioxin can refer in a general way to compounds which have a dioxin core skeletal structure with substituent molecular groups attached to it. For example, dibenzo-1,4-dioxin is a compound whose structure consists of two benzo- groups fused onto a 1,4-dioxin ring. Because of their extreme importance as environmental pollutants, current scientific literature uses the name dioxins commonly for simplification to denote the chlorinated derivatives of dibenzo-1,4-dioxin, more precisely the polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), among which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), a tetrachlorinated derivative, is the best known. The polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, which can also be classified in the family of halogenated organic compounds, have been shown to bioaccumulate in humans and wildlife due to their lipophilic properties, and are known teratogens, mutagens, and carcinogens. PCDDs are formed through combustion, chlorine bleaching and manufacturing processes.[2] The combination of heat and chlorine creates dioxin.[2] Since chlorine is often a part of the Earth's environment, natural ecological activity such as volcanic activity and forest fires can lead to the formation of PCDDs.[2] Nevertheless, PCDDs are mostly produced by human activity.[2] Famous PCDD exposure cases include Agent Orange produced by Monsanto sprayed over vegetation during the Vietnam war, the Seveso disaster, and the poisoning of Viktor Yushchenko. Polychlorinated dibenzofurans are a related class compounds to PCDDs which are often included within the general term dioxins."

aS'Sir Oswald Stoll (20 January 1866  9 January 1942) was an Australian-born British theatre manager and the co-founder of the Stoll Moss Group theatre company. He also owned Cricklewood Studios and film production company Stoll Pictures, which was one of the leading British studios of the Silent era.[1] Born in Melbourne, Australia as Oswald Gray, Stoll moved to England with his mother after the death of his father. When his mother re-married, he took his stepfather\'s last name. At a young age, Stoll left school to help his mother manage first the Parthenon music hall in Liverpool, and later a regional theatre company. The company was a success, and Stoll began to buy or build city theatres. The theatre business made Stoll a wealthy man, and in 1898 he merged his business with that of competitor Edward Moss, to form Moss Empires. By 1905, almost every large town in Great Britain had an "Empire" or a "Coliseum" theatre, managed by Stoll. Beginning with the first event in 1912, and continuing until 1926, Stoll was instrumental in presenting the Royal Variety Performance (originally Royal Command Performance) a now-annual charity show benefiting the Entertainment Artistes\' Benevolent Fund. His film company Stoll Picture Productions was founded in April 1918,[2] and acquired a one-stage studio in Surbiton which the company retained until 1923.[3] A former aeroplane factory in Cricklewood was purchased in 1920 and converted to film use.[1] Particularly associated with director Maurice Elvey, Stoll\'s company maintained a connection with the film industry until 1938 when the Cricklewood studio was closed. Stoll worked with noted theatre architect Frank Matcham on several theatres, including: Stoll was a philanthropist who donated the land in 1916 for the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation, a charity in Fulham, London for disabled soldiers returning from World War I and their families.[4] The foundation continues to house disabled ex-servicemen and women to this day, but in addition also provides supported housing for veterans suffering from mental ill health, and those who, having left the Forces, have found themselves homeless. The foundation provides rehabilitative support, IT tuition, health and well-being activities and back-to-work apprenticeships to over 230 veterans. The foundation is committed to building and sustaining communities within which ex-Service people can live independently, positively and healthily. Stoll married twice. He married his first wife, Harriet Lewis, in Cardiff in 1892, and they had one daughter. Harriet died in 1902, and Stoll married Millicent Shaw the following year. Oswald and Millicent Stoll had three sons. Lady Stoll became President of the Sir Oswald Stoll Foundation following her husband\'s death. Oswald Stoll was knighted by King George V in 1919. He died in 1942 at his home in Putney, 33 Putney Hill.[5] For an analysis of Stoll\'s writings see Vincent Barnett, \'A Creditable Performance?

aS'The Houston Comets were a Women\'s National Basketball Association (WNBA) team based in Houston, Texas, United States. Formed in 1997, the team was one of the original eight WNBA teams and won the first four championships of the league\'s existence. The Comets were the first dynasty of the WNBA and won more championships than any other team in the WNBA. They began as the sister team of the Houston Rockets. The team was folded and disbanded by the league in 2008 because new ownership could not be found. The Comets were also known for courting great women\'s basketball stars. The team had among its members Cynthia Cooper (the WNBA\'s first MVP), college and national team standout Sheryl Swoopes, Kim Perrot, who succumbed to cancer in 1999, and college stars Michelle Snow and Tina Thompson. The Comets were one of the founding teams in the WNBA. They capped off the league\'s inaugural season in 1997 with a win over the New York Liberty in the WNBA championship game to win the WNBA\'s first championship. When the league expanded the next season, the Comets were moved from the Eastern Conference to the Western Conference. In 1998, they put together a win loss record of 27-3 for a .900 winning percentage - a WNBA record that still stands. They went on to repeat as championships, defeating the Phoenix Mercury in the first-ever WNBA Finals that year due to the championship game being extended into a three game championship series. In 1999, led by what was already known as the Big Three, (Cythnia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson), the Comets survived a highlight-film, last-second, court-to-court, game-winning shot by the Liberty\'s Teresa Weatherspoon in Game 2 of the finals to beat the Liberty in three games and win their third straight title, this one after the death of teammate Kim Perrot, who died of cancer. In 2000, the Comets went all the way to the Finals again, and beat the Liberty in two games to win their fourth title in a row. 2000 was the Comets\' last championship and last WNBA Finals appearance in franchise history. After Cooper retired in 2001, Houston clinched the playoffs with a 19-13 record, but lost in the first round in a sweep to the 2001 eventual champion Los Angeles Sparks. In 2002, when Swoopes was injured most of the year with a torn ACL, the Comets were able to qualify for the playoffs with a 24-8 record, but lost to the Utah Starzz in 3 games. In 2003, they qualified to the playoffs for the 7th straight year, but they lost in the first round to the Sacramento Monarchs in 3 games. They missed the playoffs for the first time in franchise history with a record of 13-21 in 2004, but returned to the playoffs with a 19-15 record, finishing 3rd. In the first round, the Comets knocked out the 2004 defending champion Seattle Storm in 3 games, but lost in the conference finals to the Sacramento Monarchs in a sweep, which Sacramento later became WNBA Champions in 2005. Houston would return to the playoffs with an 18-16 record, but lost to the 2005 defending champion Sacramento Monarchs in another sweep. 2006 was the last playoff appearance for the Houston Comets. After the Comets\' season ended in 2006, the Comets underwent major front-office changes during the off-season. In October 2006, team owner Leslie Alexander (who also owns the NBA\'s Houston Rockets team) announced he was selling the Comets, and longtime Head Coach Van Chancellor resigned in January 2007. On January 31, 2007, the WNBA Board of Governors approved the sale of the team to Hilton Koch, a Houston-based mattress and furniture businessman. Two weeks later, Comets assistant coach Karleen Thompson was named to become the team\'s new Head Coach and General Manager for the 2007 season. For the 2007 season, they would miss the playoffs for the second time in franchise history after starting the season 0-10, resulting in a 13-21 record. On December 12, 2007, team owner Hilton Koch announced that the Comets would be moving from the Toyota Center to Reliant Arena for the 2008 WNBA season.[2] This resulted in a loss of fans. The Compaq Center drew 13,000 fans, but the Reliant Arena could only house 7,200. In 2008, the Comets\' final year, they only drew an average 6,000 fans per game and sold out four games.[3] In 2008, Koch put the team up for sale, asking $10 million USD. No investors stepped up. The WNBA took over management of the Comets and disbanded the team in December 2008.[4] They stated that they would only be suspending operations in 2009, which some people saw as a sign that the franchise could be revived if an investor came in. Comets players were sent off to other teams in a dispersal draft.[5] League president Donna Orender said that the collapse of the Comets was not a sign that the WNBA was in trouble. Former player Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said that the loss of the Comets was "disturbing news" and that the Comets were integral to the WNBA.[3] The Comets played their final home game on September 15, 2008 at the Strahan Coliseum on the campus of Texas State due to Hurricane Ike. They defeated the Sacramento Monarchs 90-81. They finished the season 17-17 and missed the playoffs for the third time in their history.[3] Wanda Guyton Head Coaches: In 2010, the Detroit Shock became the Tulsa Shock.'

aS"Out of wedock: Mstislav\nWith the first: Yaroslav, Anna, Zbyslava, Predslava Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich (1050  April 16, 1113) was supreme ruler of the Kievan Rus for 20 years, from 1093 to 1113. He was not a popular prince, and his reign was marked by incessant rivalry with his cousin Vladimir Monomakh. Upon his death the Kievan citizens raised a rebellion against the Jewish merchants and Varangian officials who speculated in grain and salt. Sviatopolk was the son of Iziaslav Iaroslavich by his wife Gertrude of Poland.[1] Sviatopolk's Christian name was Michael. During his brother Iaropolk's life, Sviatopolk was not regarded as a potential claimant to the Kievan throne. In 1069 he was sent to Polotsk, a city briefly taken by his father from the local ruler Vseslav, and then he spent ten years (107888) ruling Novgorod. Upon his brother's death he succeeded him in Turov, which would remain in possession of his descendants until the 17th century. When Vsevolod Iaroslavich died in 1093, Sviatopolk was acknowledged by other princes as the senior son of Veliki Kniaz and permitted to ascend the Kievan throne. Although he participated in the princely congresses organized by Vladimir Monomakh, he is sometimes charged with encouraging internecine wars among Rurikid princes. For instance, he sided with his cousin David of Volhynia and his son-in-law Bolesaw III Wrymouth in capturing and blinding one of Galician princes. He also sided with Vladimir Monomakh in several campaigns against the Kypchaks but was defeated in the Battle of the Stugna River (1093). Sviatopolk's Christian name was Michael, so he encouraged embellishment of St Michael's Abbey in Kiev, which has been known as the Golden-Roofed up to the present. The history now known as the Primary Chronicle was compiled by the monk Nestor during Sviatopolk's reign. Sviatopolk married a Bohemian princess (Pemyslid dynasty) and in 1094 to a daughter of Tugor Khan of the Kypchaks, Olena Some sources claim that Sviatopolk used to have an out of wedlock son Mstislav who ruled Novgorod-Sieversky in 10951097 and later Volyn (10971099). It seems that he later was murdered in Volodymyr-Volynski.[2] There are little or no information on most of Svitopolk's children except Iaroslav and Zbyslava. Iaroslav and his children largely continued to rule the Principality of Turov, yielding Volyn."

aS"Today's Local News was a free, five-day-a-week broadsheet newspaper that covered northern San Diego County in California. A rare modern-day start-up of a metropolitan broadsheet newspaper, Today's Local News was the attempt by Copley Press, owner of The San Diego Union-Tribune, to get full-market coverage in the prosperous North County region also covered by the Lee Enterprises-owned North County Times and The Coast News. Copley began printing the new suburban paper November 4, 2004, delivering more than 75,000 copies free to homes from Tuesday to Sunday. Editorially, the paper appeared to be a complement to the Union-Tribune and not a replacement. Its content is almost entirely local, with a concentration on community news and features rather than state and national affairs. One recent profile highlighted an Oceanside resident who works as a veterinary technician. Since its launch, Today's Local News dropped Tuesday publication (going from six to five days a week) and, in October 2006, eliminated 26 positions. The staff write stories for the new paper that sometimes also appear in the North sections of the Union-Tribune. Today's Local News has been a source of much controversy in the community, due to its practice of delivering its newspapers curbside, even when the previous day's paper has not been taken in. Residents are unable to stop the delivery. This has caused excessive littering throughout the service area, and has been a source of ill-will with residents.

aS'Formby railway station is a railway station in the town of Formby, Merseyside, England. The station is located on the Southport branch of the Merseyrail network\'s Northern Line. The station has a car park and a newsagent. Formby opened in 1848 as an intermediate station on the Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway. It became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1904, who took over from the LCSR. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was Grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948 and in 1978 the station became part of the Merseyrail network\'s Northern Line (operated by British Rail until privatisation in 1995). Formby is mentioned in the song "Slow Train" by Flanders and Swann. This is because the Beeching Report listed Formby as a station to be closed, along with the entire Liverpool to Southport route. The ticket hall and the stairs to the platforms are currently being refurbished with new flooring, lighting and windows being fitted. Trains operate every 15 minutes throughout the day from Monday to Saturday and on summer Sundays to Southport to the north, and to Hunts Cross via Liverpool Central to the south.

aS'Glutamate receptor, metabotropic 6, also known as GRM6, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the GRM6 gene.[1][2] L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and activates both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, that have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group I includes GRM1 and GRM5 and these receptors have been shown to activate phospholipase C. Group II includes GRM2 and GRM3, while Group III includes GRM4, GRM6, GRM7 and GRM8. Group II and III receptors are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade but differ in their agonist selectivities.[1] This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.

He visited Pakistan after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the early 1980s, and brought his family to Pakistan in 1985. There he worked for charities assisting Afghan refugees. In his youth, Khadr was known as the "problem child" in the family, frequently running away and getting in trouble, refusing to follow any rules, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes. He had an older sister, three younger brothers and a younger sister.[4][5] In 1994 at the age of 12, he was sent to Khalden training camp along with his older brother Abdullah, where he was given the alias Osama.[5] The two young brothers fought constantly at the camp, and one day their argument became so heated that they pointed guns at each other, screaming with fury. A trainer stepped between them.[6] In 1997, a dispute between the brothers was mediated by the older Abu Laith al-Libi, who earned their confidence and respect telling them about the city of Dubai and imported Ferraris; he was later described as "really cool" by Abdurahman.[5] While the family was briefly living in Nazim Jihad with Osama bin Laden\'s family in 1998, Abdurahman became close friends with Abdulrahman bin Laden, who was near his age, and the only child in the group to have his own horse, a fine Arabian.[7] Abdurahman successfully persuaded his father to buy him a horse, too.[8] Once, when the two horses fought, the young bin Laden pointed a gun at Khadr, yelling at him to stop the fight before his prized Arabian was killed.[7] When the family was leaving the compound, Abdurahman and Abdullah fought over seating in the car.[5] Their mother ended up asking bin Laden if he could take care of the troublesome Abdurahman since "she could not control him. He grudgingly agreed to look after the youth until his father returned. But, the next day bin Laden told Abdurahman that it would not work, and he asked Saif al-Adel to take the 16-year old to the bus station so he could catch up with his family en route back to Peshawar.[5] The following year, at age 13, Abdurahman was sent to Jihad Wel al-Farouq for seven days; US officials have said the training camp was run by al-Qaeda personnel to train their militants.[9] On August 20, 1998, the Al Farouq training camp was bombed by American cruise missiles and Amr Hamed, a friend of Khadr\'s, was killed. Khadr later said as a youth, he had hated the Americans for killing his friend.[5] In November 2001 at the age of 19, Khadr was captured by the Northern Alliance in Kabul, where he was wandering around. An elderly man later claimed that Khadr had installed an anti-aircraft gun on the roof of a house.[4] He was transferred to United States authorities on suspicion of having killed an American medic, but was released.[10] He later claimed to have been captured several other times, and released each time.[8] At this point, Accounts differ. Khadr claims he lived for nine months in a CIA safe house near the American Embassy in Kabul, and worked abroad as an informant.[8] But other sources say he was taken to Guantanamo Bay on March 21, 2002 and held as an enemy combatant.[11] The New York Times later reported that the CIA offered Khadr a contract in March 2003 and asked him to work as an infiltrator for American intelligence in Guantanamo, to be paid $5,000 and a monthly stipend of $3000.[12] While in Cuba, Khadr worked to obtain information from his fellow inmates before spending five additional months at the Camp X-Ray prison, where he claims to have been given training as an undercover CIA operative. The Department of Defense published height and weight records for all but ten of the captives held in Guantanamo.[13] Khadr is one of the ten men whose height and weight records were withheld. Khadr was listed as "Abdul Khadr" on the DOD\'s official list of Guantanamo detainees.[citation needed] The Department of Defense has not offered an explanation for why no records for those ten men were published. The United States later said that Khadr had been removed from the camp in July 2003. But the Washington Post reported that an October 9, 2003 memo summarized a meeting between General Geoffrey Miller and his staff and Vincent Cassard of the ICRC; it acknowledged that camp authorities were not permitting the ICRC to have access to Khadr and three other detainees, due to "military necessity".[14] Khadr says he was later given a bogus passport and boarded a Gulfstream jet assigned to CIA Director George Tenet. He said that after a stop-over in Portugal, he landed in Bosnia where he was asked to conduct a spy operation at mosques in Sarajevo.[8][15] Khadr states that he tried to approach Canadian embassies in various nations and was rebuffed at all of them. He phoned his grandmother Fatmah el-Samnah while in Sarajevo and asked her to go to the Canadian media and tell them that he had been stranded and refused entry back into Canada. He was finally granted admission to the Canadian embassy in Bosnia and was flown back to Canada on November 30, 2003. On December 4, 2003, Khadr held a press conference with his attorney Rocco Galati. He discussed his role in the War on Terror, but omitted later claimed cooperation with the CIA.[5][16] The following month, he denied reports by the Toronto Star that he had been released in exchange for giving the Americans information on the location of his father, who was killed in a Predator drone airstrike in Waziristan two weeks before Abdurahman\'s release.[17] In March 2004, Khadr gave a series of three interviews to PBS, which became the basis of a documentary entitled Son of al Qaeda. (He had largely passed a polygraph test.) He claimed to have grown up in "an al-Qaeda family", and said that he resented his father for associating with militants.[8][18] Khadr has offered a number of conflicting accounts of his life. For example, he has claimed that he was as young as 9 when he began attending Afghan training camps, and that he remained in them until as late as 2003, years after he had not only been kicked out of the camps, but was detained by the United States.[19] He has repeatedly made comments suggesting that everything up until his most recent story was a lie.[19] In July 2004, Khadr was denied a Canadian passport by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, on the explicit advice of Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham, by invoking the royal prerogative. Graham claimed the decision was "in the interest of the national security of Canada and the protection of Canadian troops in Afghanistan." National security was not listed as a ground of refusal in the Canadian Passport Order at the time, thus requiring the use of royal prerogative. It was, however, added as a ground shortly thereafter on September 22, 2004.[20] Under the terms of the amendment, the Minister was empowered to revoke or refuse to renew or issue a passport on national security grounds. Khadr sought judicial review of the Minister\'s decision.[21] On June 8, 2006, the Federal Court of Canada ruled that the Minister did not have the power to deny Khadr\'s passport in the absence of specific authority set out in the Canadian Passport Order, but stated in obiter dicta that if the Order were to be amended (as it had been after the fact), Khadr would likely not be able to challenge the revocation.[22] On August 30, 2006, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, then Peter MacKay, with the support of Prime Minister Stephen Harper, again denied Khadr\'s application, this time on the basis of the now-amended Canadian Passport Order.[23] On January 9, 2005 Variety reported plans to make a movie based on Khadr\'s life.[26] Variety reported the movie deal might be worth "mid to high six figures" to Khadr. On June 5, 2005 Variety reported that Kier Pearson, the screenwriter for Hotel Rwanda, would be working on a script for Paramount Pictures.[27]'

aS'Kenny Anderson, known primarily by his stage name King Creosote,[2] is an independent singer-songwriter from Fife, Scotland. To date, Anderson has released over forty albums, with his latest, That Might Well Be It, Darling, released in 2013.[3] Anderson is also a member of Scottish-Canadian band, The Burns Unit. In 2011, Anderson\'s collaborative album with Jon Hopkins, Diamond Mine, was nominated for the Mercury Prize. Anderson\'s brothers are also musicians: Ian Anderson (known as Pip Dylan) and Gordon Anderson (Lone Pigeon) - who is lead singer and main songwriter with The Aliens. The three frequently collaborate at live shows and on album releases. After having featured in Scottish bands Skuobhie Dubh Orchestra and Khartoum Heroes, in 1995 Kenny Anderson launched the Fence record label and began recording albums under the name King Creosote.[4] Anderson founded Fence Records alongside Johnny Lynch,[5] but stepped back from day-to-day running of the label in 2010. In recent years, Anderson has teamed up with Domino Records who have co-released some of his albums. He also spent some time on Warner subsidiary, 679, which gave him major label backing for the first time. His increasing frustration with the music industry and how digital recordings are becoming throwaway commodities led him to release his material in small, vinyl only runs which were largely only available at concerts. To this end, KC Rules OK was re-released in 2006 with different versions of some songs, and a version of the album called "Chorlton and the Wh\'earlies" recorded with The Earlies was available with some purchases. Bombshell was released with an additional disc, a DVD film of King Creosote and friends on tour. In a June 2008 interview on BBC 6 Music, mistakenly introduced as "King Creole", he told Tom Robinson that he\'d like to play a festival every weekend this summer and then return home for the weekdays. In the 2007 film Hallam Foe two of his songs, "The Someone Else" and "King Bubbles in Sand", were featured.[6] In late 2009, Anderson released a new studio album Flick the Vs, and crafted a performance only album, entitled My Nth Bit of Strange in Umpteen Years. Anderson also contributed to the Cold Seeds collaborative album along with Frances Donnelly of Animal Magic Tricks, and Neil Pennycook and Pete Harvey from Meursault; which was released on the Edinburgh-based indie label Song, By Toad Records. Anderson, Donnelly and Pennycook all wrote songs for the project, which all four performers then recorded together; each singer often taking the lead vocal role on a song written by another of the artists. The album was given a special limited release at the Fence Records Homegame Festival in Anstruther, Fife in March 2010, before a general release was announced for June 2010. In 2011, Anderson attended the SxSW Music Festival and played a number of shows, two of which featured fellow Scottish attendees Kid Canaveral as his backing band. The same year, Anderson released Diamond Mine, a collaborative album with electronica composer Jon Hopkins, to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize, with Anderson stating, "It feels like this is the beginning of something. And to feel that so far down the line, after putting out forty effing albums, oh my God! It means, I can still do this, it\'s not over."[7] The duo subsequently released an EP, Honest Words. In 2013, Anderson released That Might Well Be It, Darling, a full-band re-recording of his limited edition vinyl album, That Might Be It, Darling.'

New Zealand arrived in Great Britain for the first time since the 1995 World Cup, having already lost a test series 1-2 with Australia. It was the first full tour of Great Britain by a New Zealand side since 1993. Many of the squad, including coach Frank Endacott, had been involved in the Auckland Warriors' 1998 season, where they had finished 15th out of 20 clubs. In addition to this the Auckland Rugby League were looking to sell the club during the tour. The squad included two sets of brothers; the Iros, Kevin and Tony and the Pauls, Robbie and Henry.[1] They won the first two test matches 22-16 and 36-16 before being held to a 23-all draw in the third and final test match. Australian referee Bill Harrigan controlled all three Test matches. In the second test match Great Britain were ahead 16-8 at halftime before letting in 28 points in the second half to lose the match and the series.[2] New Zealand next competed against Great Britain in the 1999 Tri-Nations but did not tour Great Britain again until the 2000 World Cup. The next full tour was conducted in 2002 which saw a drawn test series 1-all. The Auckland Warriors were sold to a consortium that included majority investor the Tainui tribe as well as Graham Lowe and Malcolm Boyle.[3] Kiwi coach Frank Endacott was replaced as Warriors coach and several Kiwis left the club included Stephen Kearney, Quentin Pongia, and Kevin Iro. Endacott's next coaching assignment would be the 1999 ANZAC Test on 23 April."

aS'Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel is a one-off television documentary presented by Richard Hammond and first broadcast on 23 December 2007 on BBC Two.[1] The show was produced by Visual Voodoo and the executive producer was Ben Devlin. This was filmed 4 months before Evel\'s death. The documentary is based around the Evel Knievel Days event in Butte, Montana. The presenter, Richard Hammond, spends four days with former motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel. Knievel, by now 69 years old, had become very ill, requiring an oxygen tank strapped up to him constantly to aid with breathing. 48 hours before the film crew arrived, Knievel had a stroke.[2] At several points during filming, Knievel cuts the interview short and leaves before Hammond has finished asking questions. During the festival Knievel was meant to lead a bike parade, and invited Hammond to ride alongside him, but he was taken to hospital and was unable to lead the parade. He later showed up at the end of the day. On the last day of the festival fellow daredevil Trigger Gumms completed a jump over double what Evel jumped. The day after in the local newspaper Knievel stated he was not impressed with the jump. Hammond also conducts interviews with Knievel\'s former bodyguard Gene Sullivan, former daredevil Debbie Lawler and his former publicist Shelly Saltman, who was assaulted by Knievel in 1977, an attack which destroyed Evel\'s reputation and eventually caused him to declare himself bankrupt. On the final day of filming, Evel asked Hammond to go and view his tombstone which he had paid for himself. Archive clips shown during the programme and discussed with Knievel include his jumps at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, Snake River Canyon, Idaho and Wembley Stadium, London as well as his conversion in the Crystal Cathedral in California. Evel died four months after the show was filmed but before the programme was first broadcast. Knievel is sympathetically but, at the same time, revealingly portrayed as a bitter old man that surely lives up to his legend (showing up for disturbing screenings and even more challenging interviews about his former traumatic failures, despite being ill and in excruciating pain, but displaying nothing more than a grudgy attitude), but is reluctant to face the moral challenges that come with re-living his relationships with his family, his "rock\'n\'roll star" behaviour patterns and, ultimately, the issue of surviving his career by a long stretch. Knievel\'s inner controversies are captured in his reluctance to be interviewed by Hammond in the first place, and punctuated by editing and writing of the documentary. Hammond feels somewhat embarrassed to pursue his goal of clarifying the feelings of Evel about his career during the interviews (given the struggle between admiration and ire of being constantly put off by Knievel), and thus gives the viewer even more insight into the Evel\'s personality and the phenomenon behind his popularity. Finally, the film clearly shows Knievel shutting himself off the BBC filming team, as he finally thanks Hammond in a polite way, but firmly advises him to "get on his airplane and get outta here". Filming took place on location in Butte, Montana from 2529 July 2007. It can be seen during the programme that Sony DVW-790WSP Digital Betacam cameras were used to provide a widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio) 576i standard definition picture.[3] The documentary progresses through the five filming days in sequence. Pre-arranged interviews with Knievel and other related persons are combined with archive footage, some of which is also shown to the interviewee. Around this, some coverage of the Evel Knievel Days festival is provided, and the sections are linked together by piece to camera segments by Hammond or shots of Hammond riding around Butte on a rented Harley-Davidson motorcycle with voice-over. Hammond conveyed his thoughts before and after a days filming in a video-diary style filmed in his hotel room at the Lincoln Hotel. In an interview with Radio Times, Hammond described himself as being "fascinated, terrified and elated" to be in the company of Evel Knievel. Hammond said that during the filming, Knievel "shouted at me, the crew and the people with him constantly"[4] James Waltonwriting for The Daily Telegraphsaid he was surprised to find Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel "a pretty rich documentary" describing its real strength as "[serving] up lashings of the kind of pure Americana that many other British documentaries have striven much harder for, without matching."[5] The Scotsman presented a more mixed view saying it was a "much more reflective Top Gear-related product than usual" but commented that "Knievel was clearly getting fed up of Hammond and, frankly, I was getting tired of him". In contrast to Hammond\'s conclusion that Knievel was still his hero, the journalist wrote "For those of us who didn\'t play with the wind-up motorbike doll when we were six, [Knievel] didn\'t seem all that heroic".[6] The Observer\'s Roger Alton describes the show as one of the highlights of the Christmas period when it was first shown, calling it a "fantastic achievement" and describing it as a "stunning, poignant, visually saturated interview".[7] Paul Hirons on the TV Scoop website described it as a "entertaining and poignant documentary" and admired Hammond\'s "refreshingly non-arse-kissy approach to interviewing his hero" but described it as "a shame" that Knievel had not warmed to Hammond.[8] David Belcher\'s article in The Herald was far more critical describing it as "hellish to witness grievous damage being done to the Hamster\'s cuddly reputation by the ill-advised documentary farrago that was Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel." He described Hammond\'s "worship" of Knievel as "oddly punitive" as he "pursued the dying man through the streets of his shabby home town, Butte, Montana."[9] The programme finished second in its 9 p.m. timeslot on its first showing in the UK, obtaining 4.4 million viewers which corresponded to an 18% audience share. It beat ITV1\'s terrestrial premiere of the film Vanity Fair which obtained an audience 2.6 million but was beaten by Monarchy: the Royal Family At Work on sister channel BBC One which drew 5.3 million viewers. The programme was preceded on BBC Two by the last episode of Top Gear\'s 2007 series (and the evening was promoted as "Top Gear Night") which had obtained 6.8 million viewers, 2.4 million more than the number that watched Richard Hammond Meets Evel Knievel[10]'

aS'The Sims 3: Island Paradise is the tenth expansion pack for The Sims 3 series from Electronic Arts and was released on June 25, 2013. It is available on both Windows and OS X. The release dates vary from continent to continent, but in the US as stated above, it was released on June 25, 2013. In Australia it was released on June 27, 2013 and in Europe, it was released on June 28, 2013. Island Paradise is a vacation and adventure-themed expansion, similar to The Sims: Vacation, The Sims 2: Bon Voyage, and The Sims 3: World Adventures. It was created by EA Maxis (Redwood Shores) and is published by Electronic Arts. One of the key new features is the option for Sims to own houseboats. These can be docked at any unoccupied port, or anchored anywhere in the ocean, and the player can have a Sim drive the boat wherever they want, as well as retain control of the other Sims in the household as the boat moves. Houseboats function the same way as other lots: The player can build on them as they see fit and services (newspaper delivery, mail, etc) will use speedboats and jetskis to access them. The expansion pack also introduces the Scuba diving skill, which will allow Sims to dive underwater at certain points on the map, for a few in-game hours at a time. Whilst diving, Sims can catch fish, explore underwater caves, find sunken treasure, as well as use a limited set of social interactions. Sharks will occasionally appear during a dive, and may attack, and even kill Sims. Sims can also drown if they stay underwater for too long and use up their oxygen supply, although a new lifetime reward allows them to breathe indefinitely. After a Sim returns to the surface, they will have to decompress for a short amount of time before diving again. Sims can now own and manage resorts, that will provide a daily cash income based on the net profit they make. The player can increase the amount of money they get by increasing the guest capacity, as well as providing anemities (fitness equipment, swimming pools, buffet tables, etc) for guests, in order to increase the resort\'s rating and allow the hotel to charge higher prices. The player can also manage resort staff, hiring workers and choosing their uniforms. Mermaids are the new life state introduced in Island Paradise. Sims can encounter them while diving, and later summon them onto land. Mermaid Sims can breathe underwater, are immune to decompression, and all young adult mermaids have a maximum diving skill. If a mermaid spends too much time out of the ocean however, they will become a normal sim. Isla Paradiso is the new world that is launched with the expansion pack. \'Isla Paraso\' is Spanish for Island Paradise. The new world is quite large, with various types of islands that vary in size and are both inhabited and uncharted, which can be found and explored by sims. There are numerous types of dive spots, which provide the experience to scuba dive and explore never before experienced features in the sims franchise that test your sims bravery and courage. The world comes with more beaches then often, as there is an abundance of islands. There are pre existing resorts that can be edited and managed by sims from first play.[4] The Sims 3: Island Paradise was announced during a live broadcast on January 8th 2013, where a full line up of upcoming expansion packs and stuff packs of the 2013 year were revealed. At this time, only a screenshot was shown. Afterwards however, numerous live broadcast were presented and new features were shown: February 14th\'s broadcast revealed houseboats, April 16th\'s broadcast the new resort system and the final broadcast on June 18th, developers showed off the new underwater feature and hidden island aspect to the game. [5][6][7][8] The first official trailer of Island Paradise was released on June 17, 2013, a day before the final live broadcast. [9][10] Island Paradise will include a number of new features, including boats, diving, and hotels. This new expansion pack introduces more control over the environment, including price control and dynamic selection. If the game is preordered either by Origin or in stores, an unlockable set will be available with new exclusive items. The Island Survival Pack extends your survival skills with survival theme decor, furniture and clothing. [13] The EA download manager, Origin, launched an Island Paradise Community Challenge, where buyers of the game from their North America site would receive a free copy of The Sims 3 Barnacle Bay if 4,000 copies of the game were purchased before June, 21st 2013. The challenge went from June 6th 2013 to June 21st 2013 and was successful. [14] The Game Scouts: "Island Paradise arrives ideally at the start of Summer. The pack integrates excellently with other expansions like Seasons. While at first glance it may seem like a targeted release, its all-encompassing in its reach and offers something for every player. " [20] Giancarlo Saldana from Games Radar remained positive and praised the overall experience of the game even though he believed the underwater feature is a disappointment, as there are only limited diving spots - "Though [the] underwater sections are lacking, the rest of Island Paradise is a great display of what The Sims 3 can still offer fans." but states that the new features are a real highlight for the overall series - "...the features it brings to the table are definitely some of the best the series has seen."[21] 9. http://www.thegamescouts.com/2013/06/the-sims-3-island-paradise.html'

aS'Legio decima Gemina (Tenth Twin Legion), was one of the four legions used by Julius Caesar in 58 BC, for his invasion of Gaul. There are still records of the X Gemina in Vienna in the beginning of the 5th century. The legion symbol was a bull. Early on in its history, the legion was called X Equestris (mounted), because Caesar once used the legionaries as cavalry. In the Gallic wars, X Equestris played an important role on Caesar\'s military success and for this reason is sometimes said to be his favorite. In Caesar\'s campaigns they were present in the battle against the Nervians, the invasions of Britain, and the siege of Gergovia. They remained faithful to Caesar in the civil war against Pompey, being present in the battles of Pharsalus (49 BC) and Munda (45 BC). In 45 BC Caesar disbanded the legion, giving the veterans farmlands near Narbonne in Gaul and in Hispania. The legion was reconstituted in 42 BC and fought for Augustus (then Octavian), Lepidus and Mark Antony in the Battle of Philippi against the murderers of Caesar. After this, they followed Mark Antony in his campaign against Parthia and were defeated with him at Actium. Augustus then took control of the legion and settled the veterans in Patras. The legion rebelled and lost its cognomen Equestris as punishment. Reinforcements were added from other legions, and the Tenth was rebaptized Gemina. The newly formed X Gemina was relocated to Hispania Tarraconensis, where Augustus was preparing a campaign against the Cantabrians. They stayed in Hispania for many years and their veterans were among the first inhabitants of modern Zaragoza and EMERITA Augusta, modern Mrida. In 70, after the Batavian rebellion was suppressed by Vespasian, X Gemina was sent to Batavia in Germania Inferior to police the lands and prevent new revolts. From 71 to 103, the legion was stationed at the base built by II Adiutrix at Oppidum Batavorum, the present day Dutch city of Nijmegen. As part of the army of Germania Inferior, X Gemina fought against the rebellion of the governor of Germania Superior, L. Antonius Saturninus, against Emperor Domitian. For this reason, the Tenth  as well as the other legions of the army, I Minervia, VI Victrix, and XXII Primigenia  received the title Pia Fidelis Domitiana, "faithful and loyal to Domitian", with the reference to the Emperor dropped at his death. During the Trajan\'s first campaign in Dacia (101-102) the legion participated at the Second Battle of Tapae fought against the army of the Dacians led by King Decebalus. In 103, it was moved to Aquincum and later to Vindobona (modern Vienna), in Pannonia Superior, which would be the legion\'s camp until the 5th century. Vexillationes of the X Gemina fought against the rebellion of Simon bar Kokhba in 132-135, in Iudaea, others participated in the Parthian campaign of Lucius Verus in 162. Another major campaign was the one fought against the Quadi, Marcomanni and the Lombards, under the command of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. X Gemina supported its governor, Septimius Severus, in his bid for purple, and many men of the legion went to Rome to become part of the Praetorian Guard of the new Emperor. During the 3rd century, the legion fought for several emperors, who awarded the legion with titles showing the fidelity of the legion and the favour gained by the Emperor himself. The titles Antoniniana (awarded by Caracalla or Elagabalus), Gordiana (by Gordian III), Deciana (by Decius), Floriana (by Florianus), and Cariniana (by Carinus) were short-lived, however, and dropped after the death of the Emperor. For its support of Emperor Gallienus against Postumus, the Gemina was awarded the title Pia VI Fidelis VI, "six times faithful, six times loyal". At the time in which Notitia Dignitatum was written (late 4th century), the first detachment of Decima Gemina was under the command of the Magister Militum per Orientem, and was a comitatensis unit.[1] The other detachment was still in Vindobona, under the command of the Dux Pannoniae primae et Norici ripensis.'

aS"The 2000 Pittsburgh Panthers football team represented the University of Pittsburgh in the 2000 college football season. The previous season saw Pitt miss the post season by finishing 5-6. For 2000, Pitt looked to find a replacement at defensive back for NFL drafted Hank Poteat. The season started out with a 30-7 win over Kent State.[1] The Panthers then travelled to Bowling Green, winning there 34 - 16 and improving to 2-0 for the first time since 1995.[2] Pitt then hosted Penn State for the two teams last scheduled meeting, which Pitt won 12-0. This was Pitt's first win against Penn State in 8 games and improved Pitt to 3-0, their best start since 1991.[3] Pitt continued their winning ways with a 29-17 win over Rutgers, despite seven turnovers by the Panthers.[4] Pittsburgh's winning streak would come to an end at Syracuse in double overtime fashion, 17-24.[5] Pitt would come back two weeks later with an impressive win over Boston College. BC came into the game with the second ranked passing defence in the country, but not after Pitt quarterback John Turman threw for 332 yards and five touchdown passes. Running back Kevan Barlow also contributed, running for 209 yards on 25 carries including a 45-yard touchdown run, in the 42-26 Pitt victory.[6] The following game required a road trip to, then ranked second in the nation, Virginia Tech. Pitt led Tech 34-27 going into the fourth quarter, due mostly to their passing attack. John Turman threw for 311 yards and 4 touchdown passes in the game. Without starting quarterback Michael Vick, Virginia Tech came back in the fourth quarter, scoring 10 points, to win the game 34-37. Pittsburgh only gained 24 yards on the ground and the defence gave up 477 yards.[7] Pittsburgh would then host North Carolina, who would upset the Panthers 17-20 despite holding a 407-293 disadvantage in total offence.[8] Pittsburgh would then have to visit another top ranked team on the road with a trip to, then ranked second in the nation, Miami. Pittsburgh would have its worst offensive performance of the season, gaining only 266 yards, in the 7-35 loss. The Panthers have now lost 3 straight and their record is 5-4.[9] Pittsburgh clinched their first winning season since 1997 and recorded their second shutout, first time since 1987, with a 7-0 win at Temple despite 6 Panther turnovers. Wide Receiver Antonio Bryant, who gained 81 yards on 6 receptions and recorded the games only touchdown, broke the Big East record for most receiving yards in a season with 1,154 yards.[10] Pitt would end the season 7-4, their best since 1989, with a 38-28 win over West Virginia. Pitt running back Kevan Barlow, playing in his last home game as a Panther, rushed for a career high 272 yards and 4 touchdowns, 1,053 yards for the season. Only Tony Dorsett had rushed for more yards in a single game. Barlow also broke a record for most yards gained against a West Virginia defence.[11] Pittsburgh accepted a bid to play in the Insight.com Bowl, Pittsburgh's second bowl game under Walt Harris, against Iowa State. The contest was the first football game played at the home field of Major League Baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks, Bank One Ballpark. Pitt scored on their first possession by way of a 72 yard Antonio Bryant touchdown reception from quarterback John Turman. Iowa State would then go on to score 27 unanswered points. Pitt would score twice unanswered to start the second half, a Rod Rutherford 2-yard touchdown run and an Antonio Bryant 44-yard touchdown reception. Pitt would miss the extra point to make the score 20-27. Pittsburgh would then give up a 72-yard punt return for a touchdown by Iowa State's JaMain Billups, 20-34. Next, Pitt's Nick Lotz would kick a 25-yard field goal to make it 23-34 with 11:08 left in the game. On Iowa State's ensuing possession, they fumbled on first play at their own 29. Kevan Barlow would score from 3 yards out with 9:45 left in the game. A failed 2-point conversion made the score 29-34. Iowa State would add a 41-yard field goal with 4:53 left, 29-37. Pitt's comeback drive would be ended by a Marc Timmons interception at Iowa State's 12-yard line. John Turman threw for a career high 347 yards and two touchdowns, Antonio Bryant caught 5 passes for 155 yards and 2 touchdowns, and Kevan Barlow rushed for 114 yards and 1 touchdown. Ramon Walker had 15 tackles and 2 forced fumbles.[12] [13][14] [15]"

aS'Phytosociology is the branch of science which deals with plant communities, their composition and development, and the relationships between the species within them.[1] A phytosociological system is a system for classifying these communities. The term "phytosociology" was coined in 1896 by Jzef Paczoski.[2] The aim of phytosociology is to achieve a sufficient empirical model of vegetation using plant taxa combinations that characterize univocally vegetation units. Vegetation units as understood by phytosociologists may express largely abstract vegetation concepts (e.g. the set of all hard-leaved evergreen forests of western Mediterranean area) or actual readily recognizable vegetation types (e.g. cork-oak oceanic forests on Pleistocene dunes with dense canopy in SW-Iberian Peninsula). Such conceptual units are called "syntaxa" (singular "syntaxon") and can be set in a hierarchy system called "synsystem" or syntaxonomic system. The act of creation, amelioration or adjusting the synsystem is called "syntaxonomy". Therefore, the syntaxonomic system is putatively a sufficient empirical representation of vegetation of a given territory. An International Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature, issuing the rules for naming "syntaxa" exists and its use has increased among vegetation scientists.[3] The basic unit of syntaxonomy is the "association". The association is a conceptual model of a concrete phytocoenosis (the plant component of a biocoenosis). The association is defined by its characteristic combination of plant taxa, habitat features, physiognomy, biogeographical area, role in ecological succession, historical (e.g. history of use by humans) and paleo-biogeographical relationships. Associations with floristic and territorial affinities can be grouped in larger ecological conceptual units (i.e. syntaxa) called "alliances". Similar alliances may be grouped in "orders" and orders in vegetation "classes". The setting of syntaxa in such a hierarchy makes up the syntaxonomical system, or the reference model of the given vegetation and territory. In spite of early attempts (e.g. Charles Flauhault in the late 19th century), this science started in Europe, with the Swiss botanist and ecologist Josias Braun-Blanquet (18841980). Nowadays, phytosociologists try to include higher levels of complexity in the perception of vegetation, namely by describing whole successional units (vegetation series) or, in general, vegetation complexes. These lie in the scope of Landscape Phytosociology. Other developments include the use of multivariate statistics for the definition of "syntaxa" and their environmental interpretation. On the one hand, some authors consider phytosociology to be in the scope of contemporary vegetation science, a successful approach because of its highly descriptive and predictive powers, and its usefulness in nature management issues. On the other hand, there are numerous critics who have focused on several methodological limitations: the absence of statistical approaches, the complexity and non-stability of the nomenclatural system, the mistakes in the predictive models, and certain basic assumptions. Even if in continental Europe, a complete synsystem describing vegetation types has been developed and it is a basis for habitat-type classification (e.g. NATURA 2000 typology and habitat network), there are numerous scientific experts who do not have a positive opinion about the suitability for phytosociology to be the main geobotanical approach for managing vegetation systems. An important point of disagreement is the floristic-phytosociological assumption that the forest patches of the Mediterranean species of pines mainly derived from afforestations, non-stables and incidentals. Phytosociological data contain information collected in relevs (or plots) listing each species cover-abundance values and the measured environmental variables. This data is conveniently databanked in a program like TURBOVEG[4] allowing for editing, storage and export to other applications. Data is usually classified and sorted using TWINSPAN[5] in host programs like JUICE to create realistic species-relev associations. Further patterns are investigated using clustering and resemblance methods, and ordination techniques available in software packages like CANOCO[6] or the R-package vegan.[7]'

aS'The Yellow Sea Cup (simplified Chinese: ; traditional Chinese: ; pinyin: Hunghi Gnlnqi Bi), (formerly known as the China Pub Company Yellow Sea Cup) is an annual rugby union competition currently involving clubs from four cities in China and South Korea. The competition was launched in 2005 by Simon Drakeford, Ted Gray and Mark Thomas. The Yellow Sea Cup was sponsored by China Pub Company in seasons 200809 (that is when its official name was "China Pub Company Yellow Sea Cup"). In total, three teams contest the league. The tournament is held from April to November, with various stages scheduled around domestic club competitions. There were plans to start a second division from 2010, but the idea was abandoned due to lack of sponsorship. The 2011 tournament was won by Devils of Beijing in Shanghai on November 19 in a match against their arch-rivals, Shanghai Hairy Crabs. This victory made Beijing Devils the most successful team ever, winning the competition four times. For nearly 10 years the expatriate club teams in Seoul, Beijing and Shanghai had found it difficult to play regular rugby games. Games that were truly competitive were even harder to find. The regular fixtures tended to be against the same local opposition which while a lot of fun was repetitive. Other matches were either hosting touring teams or going on tour around Asia and beyond. With this background, the Chairman of the Beijing Devils Rugby Club, Simon Drakeford, and the President of the Seoul Survivors Rugby Club, Ted Gray were chatting at the annual Manila 10s tournament in March 2004 and quickly agreed we needed to organise a tournament. They quickly brought in one of the founders of the Shanghai Hairy Crabs Rugby Club, Mark Thomas and started hatching plans for a league style tournament. The plans were developed in 2004. It was envisaged that having regular games between the 3 clubs would allow each club to play a regular scheduled 4 games each year. As there was a cup at stake it was hoped that the competition would give each team a reason to train and a truly competitive game. The format of playing home and away each year was agreed, with each half of the year having one home game and one away game. Having sorted this out the next big decision was to think of a name for the tournament. A number of options were considered, the Emperors Cup was an early favourite. The South East Asia Cup another. Euan Scottish Littleford from the Seoul Survivors first suggested the name the Yellow Sea Cup. As soon as it was mentioned, it was unanimously agreed that it was the right name. All teams would be flying over the Yellow Sea to play their games and the Yellow Sea linked together China and South Korea. After much planning on 14 May 2005, the first Yellow Sea Cup game was played. The Seoul Survivors crossed the Yellow Sea to play the Beijing Devils. In the inaugural year all games ended up being very close. Six games were played and the biggest points difference was only 8 points. In three of the six games the score was separated by only 1 or 2 points. The closely fought league was a perfect start to the Yellow Sea Cup. The honour of scoring the first Yellow Sea Cup try went to long time Seoul Survivor Canadian Brian Bruckman. On the final weekend, the Beijing Devils traveled to Seoul knowing that if they won and secured a bonus point, they would win the league. If the Beijing Devils won but did not get a bonus point Shanghai would win the league by virtue of a better points difference and if Seoul won they would win the Cup! The final result was a Seoul win and they became the first Yellow Sea Cup champions. The first years tournament was deemed to be hugely successful and provided an excellent launch for subsequent years. The second year was also very competitive. Five of the six games were won by the home team. In the fifth game of the year, the Beijing Devils once again traveled to Seoul in the autumn knowing that a win would secure the cup. This time they won away from home and won the cup. The third year again showed how difficult it is for the teams to travel away. The inevitable costs borne by the players and the Clubs means that often the away team cannot field its best team. The tournament again went down to the last game of the year. This time the Seoul Survivors were traveling to Shanghai in the knowledge that if they won the game they would win the cup for a second time. On the other hand, Shanghai were determined to win so that they would not be on the end of 4 defeats out of 4 games. However the Crabs also knew that if they won they would hand the tournament to the Beijing Devils. The game was again very closely competed. The Shanghai Hairy Crabs won by 4 points and handed their arch rivals Beijing the Cup for the second year in a row. After 3 successful years, the founders of the tournament felt that it would be a good time to try to bring some new teams into the league. One of the few issues that had arisen in the tournament was that the clubs were finding it hard to persuade players to be visiting the same city each year. A number of different teams were approached and the Guangzhou Rams became the fourth team to join the league. In 2008, another tremendously important event took place. The league found a sponsor. The China Pub Company generously agreed to sponsor the tournament for a minimum of 5 years. Every year, each team is allocated a set amount by the China Pub Company. As new teams join the league the China Pub Company have committed to support each team for the same amount for as many as 10 teams. The money given to each team makes a big contribution to allow each team to more heavily subsidise players to go on tour. This in turns ensures that the traveling team is more able to field its strongest team ensuring that the competition is more closely fought. The tournament so far has been tremendously successful. The cup games have become the biggest games that the teams play each year. The teams know that to win the cup they have to train hard and travel hard. Every game has proven to be important and most of the games have gone down to the wire. Another essential part of the tournament has been the after games social activities. All hosting teams have ensured that the beer and food has flowed freely and liberally. The drinking games have been as competitive as the on field games, lasting friendships have been forged across the three (now five) clubs. In 2009, another team entered the fray, Macau. The opening game for the tournament saw Shanghai travel to Hong Kong and play out an impressive win in what seemed like a swimming pool for most of the game at King\'s Park. A surprising result was played out in Guangzhou where the Beijing Devils lost out to the Rams in a hard fought game. Next saw a strong and agile team come down to Shanghai which looked like being the decider for the tournament. In a close and often tense game the ex Taipei Baboons player Adrian scored underneath the posts to take the Crabs into half time up 10-8. The final kick of the game was retaken after one of the crabs players charged the penalty down but the kick was missed again and the Crabs won the game. The Rams were then meant to have travelled to Shanghai but could not make it and the Devils travelled to Seoul and held out for 60 minutes but the Survivors were too strong for them and came out victors. Next came the final round where Shanghai had to overcome their voodoo in Beijing by beating them to retain the cup. Having gone 9-3 down it was looking tough, but the Crabs class and power overcame a tiring Devils pack to push to victory and complete an historic double, and underline their often quoted title as \'Best Team in China\'. 2005 Fixtures 2006 Fixtures 2007 Fixtures 2008 Fixtures 2009 Fixtures 2010 Fixtures 2011 Fixtures 1.

Founded in 1891 as Buena Vista College, it is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church. The university\'s 60-acre (240,000m2) campus is situated on the shores of Storm Lake, a 3,200-acre (13km2) natural lake. BVU\'s academic programs feature a balance between traditional liberal arts courses and hands-on learning opportunities, such as travel and internships. The university awards its faculty with the $30,000 George Wythe Award for Teaching Excellence, one of the largest faculty awards in the nation. The average student-to-professor ratio is 13:1. At its inception, the college was housed in the Storm Lake Opera House, where it remained for only a year. Old Main, the college\'s first building, opened in 1892, and was occupied by faculty and students until it burned down in 1956. Major construction projects in the 1950s and 1960s extended the college, which soon included three dormitories, a library, and a number of classroom buildings. The college gained accreditation in 1952, and began to grant degrees under the authority of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The first graduate degrees were offered in 1995, at which time the college became Buena Vista University. The main campus of Buena Vista University offers a 4-year residential collegiate experience and currently offers classes in 42 majors. Fifteen additional locations throughout Iowa and online serve working adult and graduate students as part of the Graduate & Professional Studies program. The university is ranked in the top 20 Midwestern Comprehensive Colleges, as reported by U.S.News and World Report\'s college rankings. In 2012, BVU was ranked 9th for academic quality in the Midwestern Baccalaureate category. The various major study areas of Buena Vista University are grouped within five schools, each of which is administered by a dean. The Harold Walter Siebens School of Business offers majors in accounting, business economics, finance and banking, international business, management and marketing. A person majoring in a business area not only engages in an intensive study of at least one specialty field, but also receives a broad base of instruction in all areas of business. The School of Communication & Arts offers majors in art, arts management, communication and graphic design, communication and performance studies, English, media studies, music, music production, and Spanish, as well as offerings in Japanese, Chinese, and German. The school is concerned with the many-faceted process of communication. The School of Education & Exercise Science offers programs in teacher education, exercise science and athletic training. Upon successful completion of a current teacher education program or exercise science program, the student may be eligible for certification by the State of Iowa to teach appropriate course work in elementary and secondary schools. Completing the athletic training program allows the student to be eligible to sit for the National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA) certification exam. The School of Science includes the fields of biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, environmental science, mathematics, physics, and general science. Although varying in their methods of instruction and content, the fields of study have common aims in the development of liberal and professional education. The School of Social Science, Philosophy & Religion draws together an interdisciplinary emphasis in the areas of history, political science, public administration, criminology and criminal justice, sociology/social work, social science, psychology, philosophy, and religion. The school challenges the student to gain an understanding of the past, a rapport with the present, and a sense for developing perspectives and priorities related to the future. Buena Vista University also offers preprofessional programs. Specific course requirements vary with each particular professional and school area and are worked out in detail with the faculty advisor. These programs include Chiropractic Medicine, Osteopathy, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Engineering, Physical Therapy, Law, Podiatry, Medical Technology, Theology, Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, and Mortuary Science. The Academic and Cultural Events Series (ACES) exposes students to some of the finest lecturers and performers in the world through the academic events (a lecture/program series) and the cultural events (a concert/performance series). ACES contributes to the universitys mission by enhancing the curriculum through experiential learning opportunities and by promoting an awareness of the diversity of cultures and perspectives that exist in the global community. This annual lecture series addresses American freedoms. Speakers have included former U.S. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter; former Prime Ministers Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Shimon Peres of Israel, F. W. de Klerk of South Africa, Margaret Thatcher and John Major of Britain; Madeleine Albright, Gen.

In 2009, the military science program began at BVU, the only such program in Western Iowa. The mission of the program is derived directly from the regulations governing the Army Reserve Officers Training Corps (AROTC) which are issued by the Army Cadet Command and Army Training and Doctrine Command. Army ROTC is an elective curriculum that students take along with their major program of study. The program is designed to give students tools, training and experiences that will help them succeed in any competitive environment. Founders Day: This day marks the official beginning of the academic year at BVU. A memorial service during the morning is an opportunity for the University community to pay tribute to BVU\'s founders and to honor members of the BVU family who have died during the preceding year. A convocation in the afternoon welcomes new students and their families to BVU. The processional through the Victory Arch: Students pass through the Victory Arch twice during their University career: on Founder\'s Day as new students, and again as part of their Commencement ceremony. As freshmen, they proceed through the Arch, toward Schaller Memorial Chapel, indicating their entrance into the BVU community. As seniors, students proceed from Schaller Memorial Chapel through the Victory Arch, signifying the end of one chapter of their lives and the beginning of another. Chapel Services: Every Thursday at 11 a.m. during the academic year, the BVU community comes together for worship. Although attendance at chapel is no longer required of students, many still enjoy and participate in this celebration of faith and community. The William W. Siebens American Heritage Lecture Series: This prestigious event features internationally-recognized leaders of business, academics, law, press, government, religion and other areas of American life. Each speaker focuses on an area of life where the matters of major rights and responsibilities are a concern. Selected students have the opportunity to interview the speakers during an afternoon session that is attended by the campus community. Homecoming Week: Homecoming week is one of the major social events of the year for students, faculty, staff and alumni. Throughout the week, students prepare for Homecoming with residence hall/suite competitions and nightly events. The week culminates with the crowning of the King and Queen, a parade and the football game and alumni reunions. All-campus Christmas Dinner: BVU\'s Office of the President and Spiritual Life host a traditional holiday dinner for all students. The evening also includes the singing of Christmas carols and Buena Vista Fight Song, the presentation of an art gift, and photos with the school mascot. Faculty and staff serve the dinner to students. Buenafication Day: Each spring, faculty, staff and students join forces to paint, plant flowers and "buenafy" the BVU campus. This tradition has also evolved into a day of service during which students do volunteer projects in the community. A morning of work and service is followed by a picnic lunch and an afternoon of games. Academic Awards Banquet: In the spring, the University recognizes those students who have excelled in their academic pursuits. Parents, faculty and staff are also included in this ceremony. Major awards, such as Senior of the Year, are announced at the event. Moonlight Breakfast: Each semester during finals week, Student Services and Sodexho Food Service host a late-night breakfast for students. Served by the Student Services staff, this is an excellent study break as students prepare for their final exams. Scholars Day: In one of the newest traditions held in the spring, students representing a cross-section of academic disciplines have the opportunity to showcase their original scholarly work in an interactive format that is open the public. Career Symposium: On the day before Homecoming, BVU alumni return to campus to participate in panel sessions to answer students questions about careers. In addition to the panel sessions, time is also scheduled for students to meet one on one with alumni. The event is sponsored by the BVU National Alumni Association. Dinner at the Presidents Home: Each fall, President and Mrs. Moore invite freshmen (via their Freshman Seminar classes) to their residence, the McCorkle House, for dinner. Its an opportunity for the students to get to know the president and a time when the president shares some of the historical background on the impact that Life Trustee Dr. Paul McCorkle and his late wife, Vivian, who was also a Trustee, have had on the University. Senior Send-off: This event started in 1999 as a brunch prior to Commencement to celebrate the time the seniors spent on campus and to wish them well in their future endeavors. The format was changed in 2007 to a picnic in Scout Park on the Friday before Commencement day. The offices of Student Services and Alumni Relations are the sponsors. Ringing of the Victory Bell: In years gone by, the Victory Bell was occasionally rung by students to celebrate football victories and to commemorate special occasions. The tradition has recently been renewed by the Alumni Association Student Board. Now, freshmen ring the bell on Founders Day, sophomores as a call to the Christmas Dinner, juniors as a call to students to gather on Buenafication Day morning, and seniors on their Commencement Day. Originally, the bell was located across from Edson Hall and was later moved to a site between Lage Communications Center and Social Sciences and Art Hall. Buena Vista University competes in 19 intercollegiate sports at the varsity level. The university is a NCAA Division III institution and a member of the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Teams that compete at BVU include baseball, men\'s and women\'s basketball, cross country, football, men\'s and women\'s golf, men\'s and women\'s soccer, men\'s and women\'s tennis, track & field, volleyball, and wrestling. Roughly one out of every four BVU students participate in intercollegiate athletics. Buena Vista\'s mascot is the Beaver. The origins of the Beaver as the Buena Vista mascot go back to the early 1900s, when the football team was called the BVers. In the spring of 1921, a Buena Vista student combined that nickname with then-popular soft drink Bevo to create the nickname the Beavers. Ballou Building Formerly the main library facility, the Ballou Building houses the Offices of the President and Institutional Advancement, including the National Alumni Association. The lower level still houses the Allee Curriculum Library, containing 7,800 volumes; a student lounge and other library materials. Dixon-Eilers Hall Dixon-Eilers Hall houses BVU\'s business offices and the Office of the Registrar, in addition to housing classrooms. The building was completed in 1958 and stands on the site of the original "Old Main." Edson Hall Originally known as Victory Hall, the University gym before Siebens Fieldhouse was constructed in 1969, Edson Hall is now home to the BVU music department. Renovation of the hall was completed in early 1997 with the addition of a choral rehearsal room, nine state-of-the-art practice rooms, a piano/keyboard lab, a student work area, and additional office space. Estelle Siebens Science Center Completed in the summer of 2004, the 70,000 square feet (6,500m2) facility comfortably houses BVU\'s five interdisciplinary fields of science (biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics), fostering collaboration among the disciplines, as well as between students and faculty. The 18 laboratories complement seven classrooms, three research areas, and 24 offices. "Science Avenue," a prominent atrium corridor that puts projects on display, connects the two-story, glass-walled rotunda (nicknamed "The Beaker") to a greenhouse with three environmental growth chambers. Finkbine Natatorium Named in appreciation of Frank Finkbine in memory of his wife Mae Finkbine, Finkbine Natatorium is a six-lane 25-yard (23m) competition pool. Harold Walter Siebens School of Business/Siebens Forum The Harold Walter Siebens School of Business/Siebens Forum was completed in the spring of 1985. In addition to the Harold Walter Siebens School of Business and a conference center, it houses the Student and Career Services offices, food service and cafeteria, Anderson Auditorium (a 386-seat auditorium), Siebens Den, the Geisinger Student Leadership Center, the bookstore, post office, games area and snack bar, and other offices and lounges. Included in the Harold Walter Siebens School of Business are tiered seminar rooms, a case-study seminar room, faculty offices, and a special resource room that enables students to receive the latest market information from Wall Street and other sources. The conference center includes a board room, conference rooms, lobbies, and offices. The $10 million building, made possible by an $18 million gift from the late Dr. Harold Walter Siebens, also has telecommunication capabilities. Information Technology Center/BVU Library The BVU Library is a state-of-the-art facilitiy with a capacity of 300,000 printed volumes, as well as one thousand journals and periodicals. Computerized periodical databases access many sources not available in the library. A coffee shop was added to the library in 2008. Lage Communication Center Lage Communication Center is the home of telecommunication at BVU. Lage houses the radio, television and print studios for the School of Communication and Arts. It is the control center for the telecommunication system, which extends throughout campus. Lamberti Recreation Center Construction was completed in 2001 on this 65,000 square feet (6,000m2) addition to the Siebens Fieldhouse. It features a six-lane indoor track, three courts for basketball, volleyball and tennis, an exercise and weight room, coaches offices, and locker/shower facilities. The $9.5 million project, funded entirely by donors, also included an 18,000 square feet (1,700m2) renovation of the Siebens Fieldhouse. Lighthouse A 30-foot (9.1m) brick lighthouse was built on the shores of Storm Lake near Siebens Fieldhouse in 1992 in memory of Buena Vista University trustee and benefactor Harold Walter Siebens. The lighthouse was a gift from the Siebens family. McCorkle Hall McCorkle Hall was completed in January 1996 and houses 72 students in six-person suites. Peterson Field Peterson Field is the site of football, soccer, and track activity. It is home to the J. Leslie Rollins Football Stadium. The 240-foot (73m) stadium extends between the 10-yard (9.1m) lines and has a seating capacity of approximately 2,500. Formerly known as Bradford Field, the field underwent massive renovation in 2011 with the addition of an artificial turf field and new all-weather track. Field lighting was added in 2012. Schaller Memorial Chapel Schaller Memorial Chapel, dedicated in 1963, adjoins Dixon-Eilers Hall. It serves as an auditorium and theater and is used for convocation services. Special events, such as Baccalaureate and Founders Day, are held here. A small meditation chapel is located in the lower level. A special feature of the chapel is the Hansen Organ, a three-manual Reuter pipe organ with 2,048 pipes. Siebens Fieldhouse The main level of Siebens Fieldhouse houses a gymnasium, which seats 4,000 spectators. On this level are classrooms and coaches\' offices. The balcony is used for aerobics, and a large double hitting area for softball and baseball. A shot put area is also available.

The TLTC supports faculty in the integration of technology tools into teaching and learning. Victory Arch The Victory Arch was constructed from the remains of the Old Main archway. Old Main, constructed in 1893, was the principal building on campus until it was destroyed by fire in 1956. The Victory Arch is a symbol linking the past to the present. The Victory Arch stood on the southeast corner of Chapel lawn for many years before it was rebuilt atop the Harold Walter Siebens School of Business/Siebens Forum in 1984-85. The university has eight residence halls available for student living. Swope Hall The first residence hall built on campus, Swope Hall has single and double occupancy rooms available. There are 10 housing communities, each with a resident advisor available for help. Pierce and White Halls It is a double complex, comprising two buildings. Both Pierce and White are co-ed halls with four floors and seven housing communities, each with a resident advisor available for help. The buildings share a common lobby and are connected underground with the Harold Walter Siebens School of Business/Siebens Forum, the main building on campus. Extensive remodeling of both buildings was completed in 2012. Grand Hall Built in 1998, Grand Hall is a co-ed community with three floors. The building houses 100 students, including three resident advisors. The floors are separated into males and females and are connected by internal doors. Grand Hall was the first residence hall on campus to have an elevator. Liberty Hall Finished in 2002, Liberty Hall is a voluntary substance-free building, built with similar design to Grand Hall. There is space, however for a faculty member to live in the building, creating a unique sense of community. Residents choosing to live in Liberty Hall sign a pledge form to not partake in drinking alcohol or smoking and chewing tobacco while on building premises. Suites The suites are apartment-style living quarters that group six female or six male residents in a suite in three bedrooms. There are three suite buildings, Constitution, Briscoe (formerly Centennial Hall, named for former college president, Keith Briscoe) and McCorkle (formerly Heritage Hall), named for Trustee Paul McCorkle . Entrance in the suites is reserved for sophomores, juniors and seniors and is based on a point system made up of points assigned for the student\'s year and grade point average and seniority in the suites. Buena Vista University\'s Graduate & Professional Studies programs offer educational opportunities across the state of Iowa at its off-campus locations.

aS'Holochilus sciureus, also known as the Amazonian marsh rat,[2] the common marsh rat,[3] or simply the marsh rat,[1] is a rodent species from South America. Amazonian marsh rats are smaller than the common brown rat, but otherwise have a similar appearance. They range from 13 to 22 cm (5.1 to 8.7 in) in head-body length, with a tail 12 to 18 cm (4.7 to 7.1 in) long, and typically weigh between 130 and 200 grams (4.6 and 7.1 oz). They have short fur, which is tawny or buff over the back, becomes paler on the flanks, and fades to white or pale orange on the underparts. The hindfeet are noticeably larger than the forepaws, with prominent claws and partial webbing between the toes. There is also a slight fringe of longer, silvery, hair, around the soles of the feet. Females have eight or ten teats.[4] Amazonian marsh rats are found across much of northern South America east of the Andes.[1] They inhabit open areas such as grasslands, savanna, marshes, clearings in the rainforest, and farmland, at elevations up to 2,000 metres (6,600ft). Although the exact taxonomic status of some populations is unclear, two subspecies are currently recognised:[4] Amazonian marsh rats feed primarily on grass stems, although they also eat some seeds, and small quantities of sedges, other plants, and even small invertebrates. They are nocturnal, occupying a home range of as little as 0.3 hectares (0.74acre). Females construct spherical nests made of leaves in order to rear their young. These nests may be on the ground in dense vegetation or cracks in the earth, but are more commonly located 50 to 150 cm (20 to 59 in) above the ground, attached to sturdy stems such as those of sugar cane or rice plants. The inner lining of the nest consists of finely shredded leaves, with a more intact outer shell.[4] Predators include caimans, rattlesnakes, barn owls, hawks, kites, and probably crab-eating foxes.[4] They breed throughout the year, although the fertility of both sexes increases during periods of high rainfall.[5] Courtship lasts around 4 days before mating occurs, and gestation lasts 29 days. The female gives birth at night or at dawn to a litter of up to eight blind, hairless, pups, each measuring around 5cm (2.0in) and weighing 7 grams (0.25oz). The fur begins to appear after five days, and the first teeth emerge at ten days. The young are weaned a fifteen days, by which time their eyes have opened. The rats reach sexual maturity at three to four months, with females maturing more slowly than males.[4]'

aS"Mojave Moon is a 1996 American road movie.[1] It stars Danny Aiello, Anne Archer, Michael Biehn, Angelina Jolie and Jack Noseworthy. The film was written by Leonard Glasser and directed by Kevin Dowling. Al McCord is hanging out at his favourite restaurant when he meets an attractive young woman, Ellie, who is looking for a ride from the city into the Mojave Desert, where her mother Julie lives. Al discovers romance with the free-spirited Julie despite the nearby presence of her boyfriend Boyd, who seems likely to go berserk at any moment. Strange events follow and it's up to Al to find an explanation. In the desert, Al's car develops a flat tire. He opens the trunk he discovers an apparent dead body (Ellie's boyfriend Kaiser, whom Al had not yet been aware of). Al heads to a gas station for repairs, following a near run-in with a highway patrolman, when he is interrupted by an attempted robbery. The confusion created by the gun-happy gas station worker allows Al to escape unhurt. Back home, Al is visited by Ellie, followed by Julie. Unknown to him at this point, his car is being stolen. Outside they notice Boyd and flee to a nearby motel. Just after Al leaves to search for his car, Boyd arrives at the motel, taking the women back to Mojave and locking them in a shed. Al and actor buddy Sal mount a rescue mission but are themselves knocked out by Boyd. Kaiser, still alive, arrives back at Mojave unseen as Boyd drives off with Al, Sal, Julie and Ellie in the car atop his truck, intending on tipping the car and passengers over the edge of a quarry. They eventually escape uninjured while Boyd plummets to his doom, signaled by an ostentatious explosion. Ellie returns to Los Angeles with Sal, while Al remains for the night, at least, with Julie. "

aS'Claims have existed for many decades that Earth might possess other natural satellites besides the Moon. Several candidates have been proposed, but not proven, and the Moon remains Earth\'s only known natural satellite.[1] Several genuine scientific searches for more moons were undertaken in the 19th and 20th centuries, but the field has also been the subject of several non-scientific proposals and possible hoaxes. These possible hoaxes, which were about objects of specific size and orbits, were poorly founded and all have been disproven.[2] Although the Moon is Earth\'s only known natural satellite, there are a number of near-Earth objects with orbits that are in resonance with Earth. These have even, perhaps glibly, been referred to as "second moons".[3] Quasi-satellites, such as 3753 Cruithne, orbit the Sun in 1:1 resonance with Earth and may appear to orbit a point outside the Earth from a corotating reference frame. Earth trojans, such as 2010 TK7, follow the same orbital path as Earth, either trailing or following, in the vicinity of the EarthSun Lagrangian points. Small objects in orbit around the Sun can also temporarily fall into orbit about the Earth, becoming temporary natural satellites.[1] The only confirmed one was 2006 RH120, which was in Earth orbit in 20062007.[1] Additional examples of small, temporarily captured asteroids are predicted.[1] The first major claim of another moon of Earth was made by French astronomer Frdric Petit, director of the Toulouse Observatory, who in 1846 announced that he had discovered a second moon in an elliptical orbit around the Earth. It was claimed to be reported by Lebon and Dassier also at Toulouse, and Lariviere at Artenac Observatory, during the early evening of March 21, 1846.[4] Petit proposed that this second moon had an elliptical orbit, a period of 2 hours 44 minutes, with 3,570km (2,220mi) apogee and 11.4km (7.1mi) perigee.[4] This claim was soon dismissed by his peers.[5] The 11.4km (37,000ft) perigee is similar to the cruising altitude of most modern airliners.[citation needed] Petit published another paper on his 1846 observations 15 years later (1861), basing the second moon\'s existence on perturbations in movements of the existing moon.[4] This second moon hypothesis was not confirmed either. Nevertheless, Petit\'s proposed moon became a major plot point in Jules Verne\'s 1870 science fiction novel Around the Moon. Perhaps it is also the moon presiding over lunacy In 1898 Hamburg scientist Dr. Georg Waltemath announced that he had located a system of tiny moons orbiting the Earth.[7][8] He had begun his search for secondary moons based on the hypothesis that something was gravitationally affecting the Moon\'s orbit.[9] Waltemath described one of the proposed moons as being 1,030,000 km (640,000mi) from Earth, with a diameter of 700km (430mi), a 119-day orbital period, and a 177-day synodic period.[4] He also said it did not reflect enough sunlight to be observed without a telescope, unless viewed at certain times, and made several predictions as to when it would appear.[9] "Sometimes, it shines at night like the sun but only for an hour or so."[9][10] However, after the failure of a corroborating observation of Waltemath\'s moons by the scientific community, these objects were discredited. Especially problematic was a failed prediction that they would be observable in February 1898.[4] Waltemath proposed more moons, according to a mention in August 1898 issue of Science. The third moon was closer than the first, 746km (464mi) in diameter, and he called it "Wahrhafter Wetter-und Magnet Mond".[6] In 1918, astrologer Walter Gornold, also known as Sepharial, claimed to have confirmed the existence of Waltemath\'s moon. He named it Lilith. Sepharial claimed that Lilith was a \'dark\' moon invisible for most of the time, but he claimed to have viewed it as it crossed the sun.[11] In 1926 the science journal Die Sterne published the findings of amateur German astronomer W. Spill, who claimed to have successfully viewed a second moon orbiting the Earth.[10] In the late 1960s John Bargby claimed to have observed over ten small natural satellites of the Earth, but this was not confirmed.[4] William Henry Pickering (18581938) studied the possibility of a second moon and made a general search ruling out the possibility of many types of objects by 1903.[12] His 1922 article "A Meteoritic Satellite" in Popular Astronomy resulted in increased searches for small natural satellites by amateur astronomers.[4] Pickering had also proposed the Moon itself had broken off from Earth.[13] After he had discovered Pluto, the United States Army\'s Office of Ordnance Research commissioned Clyde Tombaugh to search for near-Earth asteroids. The Army issued a public statement in March 1954 to explain the rationale for this survey.[14] However, according to Donald Keyhoe, later director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in mid-1953, according to his Pentagon source. Keyhoe stated in May 1954 that the search had been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.[15] The October 1955 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine reported: At a 1957 meteor conference in Los Angeles, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for natural satellites had been unsuccessful.[17] In 1959 Tombaugh issued a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search. It was discovered that small bodies can be temporarily captured, as shown by 2006 RH120, which was in Earth orbit in 2006-2007.[1] In 2010, the first known Earth trojan was discovered in data from Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and is currently called 2010 TK7. In 2011, planetary scientists Erik Asphaug and Martin Jutzi proposed a model in which a second moon would have existed 4.5 billion years ago, and later impacted the Moon, as a part of the accretion process in the formation of the Moon.[18] Although no other moons of Earth have been found to date, there are various types of near-Earth objects in 1:1 resonance with it, which are known as quasi-satellites. Quasi-satellites orbit the Sun from the same distance as a planet, rather than the planet itself. Their orbits are unstable, and will fall into other resonances or be kicked into other orbits over thousands of years.[3] Quasi-satellites of Earth include 2010 SO16, (164207) 2004 GU9,[19] (277810) 2006 FV35,[20] 2002 AA29[21] and 3753 Cruithne. Cruithne, discovered in 1986, orbits the Sun in an elliptical orbit but appears to have a horseshoe orbit when viewed from Earth.[3][22] Some went as far to nickname Cruithne "Earth\'s second moon".[22] The key difference between a satellite and a quasi-satellite is that a natural Earth satellite\'s orbit fundamentally depends upon the gravity of the EarthMoon system whereas the orbit of a quasi-satellite would negligibly change if the Earth and Moon were suddenly removed since a quasi-satellite is orbiting the Sun on an Earth-like orbit in the vicinity of the Earth.[23] Earth possesses one known Trojan asteroid, a small Solar System body caught in the planet\'s gravitationally stable L4 Lagrangian point. The object, 2010 TK7 is roughly 300 metres long. Like the quasi-satellites, it orbits the Sun in a 1:1 resonance with Earth, rather than Earth itself. On 14 September 2006, an object estimated at 5 meters in diameter was discovered in near-polar orbit around Earth. Originally thought to be a third stage Saturn S-IVB booster from Apollo 12, it was later determined to be an asteroid and designated as 2006 RH120. The asteroid re-entered Solar orbit after 13 months and is expected to return to Earth orbit in 21 years.[24] Computer models by astrophysicists Mikael Granvik, Jeremie Vaubaillon, and Robert Jedicke of Cornell University suggest that these "temporary satellites" should be quite common; and that "At any given time, there should be at least one natural Earth satellite of 1-meter diameter orbiting the Earth."[25] Such objects would remain in orbit for ten months on average, before returning to solar orbit once more, and so would make relatively easy targets for manned space exploration.[25] "Mini-moons" were further examined in study published in the March issue of Icarus.[26] The earliest known mention[23] in the scientific literature of a temporarily captured orbiter is by Clarence Chant about the Meteor procession of February 9, 1913: And later in 1916, William Frederick Denning surmised: It has been proposed that NASA search for temporary natural satellites, and use them for a sample return mission.[1] '

aS'The Cimarron Redoubt (also known as the Deep Hole Redoubt) was an improvised U.S. Army fortification south of the city of Ashland in Clark County, Kansas, United States. Built in 1870 near a major trade route\'s crossing of the Cimarron River, it was later used for a variety of civilian purposes, including a post office. Today, it lies abandoned amid farm fields in southern Center Township. Southwestern Kansas was the location of some of the fighting of the Comanche War, fought between 1867 and 1875.[3] In order to protect traffic on the Fort Supply/Fort Dodge trail, U.S. Army soldiers built two redoubts north and south of the Cimarron River. The southern redoubt, constructed of sandbags, was erected on the eastern side of Clark Creek south of its confluence with the Cimarron,[4]:2 while the earthen northern redoubt was built along the eastern side of Bear Creek.[5] Named for the streams along which they lie, the two sites are located approximately fourteen miles apart: the Cimarron Redoubt lies nine miles south of Ashland,[4]:1 while the Bear Creek Redoubt lies five miles to the north of the city.[5] Although fighting concluded in the immediate vicinity of the redoubt by 1875, it and the Bear Creek redoubt remained necessary fortifications in the Army\'s strategy of keeping hostile Native Americans away from settled areas.[6]:31 By the late 1870s, the region was sufficiently peaceful to render the Cimarron Redoubt unnecessary, and it was left to use by local civilians. The next few years saw it converted into a store, and by 1881, it was the location of the Deep Hole post office. After an undetermined period of time, it was abandoned.[4]:3 Since that time, the redoubt has been remarkably well preserved: the tall grass that now covers it has significantly reduced the rate of erosion.[4]:2 Located in the middle of a field now used for the storage of hay, the grass-covered redoubt is Kansas\' only known sandbag fort.[4]:3 In 1978, the Cimarron Redoubt\'s excellent state of preservation led to its being placed on the National Register of Historic Places,[1] both for its historical role in military affairs and for the potential archeological value of excavation.[4]:3 The areas recognized as significant include both the fortification and some surrounding fields.[4]:7 Moreover, the National Park Service has recognized the redoubt as one of the principal sites in the valley of the Cimarron River.[7] Built by soldiers under the command of Captain John Page,[6] the redoubt was constructed in the shape of a square, sixty feet on each side.[4]:2 According to an account by Frances Roe, a later commander\'s wife who was stationed there in January 1873,[4]:3 it was laid out with many aspects of larger fortifications, such as bastions, ditches, and a ten-foot-tall parapet. Inside, the fortification included log-reinforced rooms for the garrison that, under Roe\'s supervision, were capable of becoming "clean and cheerful" for a military wife.[6] Today, the walls have been eroded somewhat, especially along Clark Creek on the redoubt\'s southern side;[4]:3 they are generally only about two or three feet above the surrounding terrain.[4]:7 Nevertheless, its structure is overall strong enough that the redoubt is expected to survive essentially intact long into the future.[4]:3'

aS"The DEL, 2nd Bundesliga and Oberliga are the first three levels of ice hockey in Germany. All three leagues operate nationwide. While the DEL is an independenty operated league, the other two are run by the German ice hockey federation, the DEB, through the ESBG. The leagues below the Oberliga are operated by the state federations (German:Landesverbnde) and don't run nationwide. The 2006-07 season for the three top leagues started on 7 September 2006 with the first round in the DEL and finished on 17 April 2007 with the third and last game of the DEL finals, with the Adler Mannheim winning their fifth DEL title. The DEL is the highest tier of German ice hockey. The league was played with 14 clubs in the 2006-07 season, the same number as the previous season. However, in place of the Kassel Huskies, who were relegated the previous season, the Straubing Tigers took part in the competition, having won the 2nd Bundesliga in 2005-06. The modus had slightly changed from the 2005-06 season. Each club played the other four times, resulting in 52 regular season games per club. The top six clubs at the end of the regular season are qualified for the first round of the play-offs. The clubs seven to ten play a preliminary round to determined the last two places for the first round. For the teams placed eleven to fourteen, the season had ended. No club was relegated from the DEL this season but one new club admitted, the EHC Wolfsburg Grizzly Adams, champion of the 2nd Bundesliga. The final table operates under the following points system: Three points for a win, two for a win after overtime or penalties, one for a loss after overtime or penalties and no points for an outright loss. The four rounds of the 2006-07 play-offs were played under the following system: Like the regular season, in the play-offs games will be decided by penalty shoot-outs (P) after a five-minute overtime (OT) sudden-death. In all play-off rounds the higher placed team from the regular season has home advantage in the uneven numbered games (Game 1, 3, 5, 7) and the other team in the even numbered games (Game 2, 4, 6). The five highest placed scores in the regular season and play-offs are: The 2nd Bundesliga is the second highest tier of ice hockey in Germany. The league played with 14 clubs in the 2006-07 season, the same number it had since 2001. Each club played each other four times during the regular season. The top eight teams in the league qualified for the play-offs to determined the 2nd Bundesliga champion who also gained promotion to the DEL this season. For the clubs placed nine and ten, the season has finished after the regular round. The bottom four clubs played out the two relegated teams from the 2nd Bundesliga. The final table operates under the following points system: Three points for a win, two for a win after overtime, one for a loss after overtime and no points for an outright loss. The three rounds of the 2006-07 play-offs were played under the following system: In all play-off rounds the higher placed team from the regular season has home advantage in the uneven numbered games (Game 1, 3, 5, 7) and the other team in the even numbered games (Game 2, 4, 6). Should a game be undecided after regular time, there will be one overtime (OT) in sudden death format. Should there still be no winner, the game is decided through penalties (P). The play downs consists of only one round, played in a best-of-seven format. The two loser of this round are relegated to the Oberliga. The Oberliga is the third tier of ice hockey in Germany and as such the lowest nationwide level, below it are currently the LEV's (Landesverbnde). In the 2006-07 season the league played with 14 clubs. However, the Ratinger Ice Aliens were excluded from the competition on 16 November 2006 and all results involving the club canceled. Each club in the league played each other club four times in the 2006-07 season. The top eight teams then took part in a best-of-seven play-off round to determined the two promoted teams to the 2nd Bundesliga. Because the EHC Wolfsburg was admitted to the DEL, a third Oberliga club was also promoted, this being the SC Riessersee which had been the best placed semi final loser. For the bottom five clubs, the league season was finished after the regular round, due to the expansion of the Oberliga no team was relegated. The teams placed nine to twelve played a cup qualification round however. The Oberliga play-offs were operating on a best-of-seven modus in the first round and semi finals. The finals were played as best-of-three. The winning teams of the semi finals are promoted to the 2nd Bundesliga. Winners promoted to 2nd Bundesliga. The levels below the Oberliga are not administrated by the DEB but rather by the local federations, the LEV's. With the ESBG's intention to increase the number of clubs in the Oberliga from 13 to 19, seven promotion places were available for the LEV clubs. The league champions and promoted clubs from the regional leagues were: The Regionalliga West is actually not quite a league but rather a promotion round. It contains the best six teams of the Regionalliga Nordrhein-Westfalen, and the top two teams of the Regionalliga Hessen and the Baden-Wrttemberg Liga each. The winner of this league is nominally promoted to the Oberliga. As such, the league covers the German states of Baden-Wrttemberg, Hessen, Saarland, Rheinland-Pfalz and Nordrhein-Westfalen. This league covers the th north and north east of Germany. Again, it is more of a promotion round, compromising nine teams. In an effort to strengthen the sport in the east of Germany, four clubs from this region were promoted to the Oberliga. The Regionalliga Nordost covers the German states of Niedersachsen, Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Berlin, Sachsen-Anhalt, Sachsen and Thringen. The Bayernliga is the only single-state league of the three, covering just Bavaria. The reason for this is that the state holds approximately one third of all ice hockey clubs in Germany and 17 of the 41 clubs in the first three divisions in 2006-07 were from this federation. "

aS"Jos-Luis Orozco (born May 6, 1948) is a bilingual (Spanish-English) childrens author, educator, and recording artist.[1] He has written three award winning books, De Colores and Other Latin American Folk Songs for Children (Dutton 1994), Diez Deditos  Ten Little Fingers (Dutton 1997), and Fiestas (Dutton 2002). Orozco recorded 13 volumes of Lrica Infantil, Latin American Children's Music and his songs have been taught by two generations of teachers.[2] Orozco is a presenter at educational conferences and seminars for teachers, parents, librarians and childcare providers who seek to use music as an important learning tool in multicultural classrooms.[3] Jos-Luis Orozco was born in Mexico City.[4] He is the second of eleven children born to Fernando Orozco and Susana Ramos. His father played the violin and his mother loved to sing. He grew fond of music at a young age, learning many songs from his paternal grandmother. At age 8, Jos-Luis became a member of the Mexico City Boy's Choir, and traveled the world visiting 32 countries in Europe, the Caribbean, Central and South America. It was from his tour around the world that he gained the cultural knowledge he now shares with children through his books and recordings.[5] At age 19, Jos-Luis moved to California. He went to college and earned his Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley and a Master's degree in Multicultural Education from the University of San Francisco.[6] Jos-Luis Orozco is the father of four and grandfather to two children. He currently lives in Los Angeles, California.[7] At age 8, Jos-Luis became a member of the Mexico City Boy's Choir, and traveled the world visiting 32 countries in Europe, the Caribbean, Central and South America. It was from his tour around the world that he gained the cultural knowledge he now shares with children through his books and recordings.[8] Jos-Luis Orozco first started performing music for children in 1970. From the beginning of his career, Orozco included bilingual songs in his repertoire, even though many of the children in his audiences did not speak Spanish.[9] In 1971, Orozco released the first of 13 volumes for children, Lirica Infantil: Latin American Children's Music, on the Bilingual Media Productions label. The album featured classic songs from Mexican, Central, and South American culture, including Guantanamera and Los Pollitos.[10] During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Orozco kept up a busy touring schedule, often giving his support to the bilingual education movement in the United States.[11] The Association of Mexican American Educators honored him in 1995.[12] In 1990, he received the Leadership Award from the California Association for Bilingual Education.[13] In 1994, he produced a bilingual songbook, De Colores, which won an American Library Association Notable Award and the American Children's Book Award, Commended List.[14] He went on to write two other award winning publications, Diez Deditos  Ten Little Fingers (Dutton 1997), and Fiestas (Dutton 2002). CDs of De Colores, Diez Deditos and Fiestas, present a bilingual collection of songs, rhymes, tongue twisters, lullabies, games and holiday celebrations gathered from Spanish-speaking countries. In 2003, Jos-Luis released a video and DVD entitled Cantamos y Aprendemos con Jos-Luis Orozco  Singing and Learning with Jos-Luis Orozco, filled with live action, animation, and Latino flavor that motivates children to learn about the Spanish language and the rich tradition of Latin American children's music.[15] In 2005, Orozco wrote Rin, Rin, Rin...Do, Re, Mi, a lyrical bilingual children's book illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner, David Daz.[16] This publication shows how everyday family activities such as cooking, singing, reading and storytelling foster essential early literacy skills such as letter recognition and language development.[17] Rin, Rin, Rin...Do, Re, Mi is the first book in a series set for publication and distribution by Scholastic's Latino initiative Lee y Sers (Read and You Will Be), which was created to improve the reading and literacy development of Latino children. In 2003 and again in 2005, Jos-Luis Orozco was invited to participate in the National Book Festival organized by the Library of Congress and hosted by First Lady, Laura Bush.[18] During the festivities in 2003, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in Washington, D.C. honored Mr. Orozco.

aS'Glenda May Jackson, CBE (born 9 May 1936) is a British Labour Party politician and former actress. She has been a Member of Parliament (MP) since 1992, and currently represents Hampstead and Kilburn. She previously served as MP for Hampstead and Highgate. After constituency changes for the 2010 general election, her majority of 42 votes was one of the closest results of the entire election.[1] As an actress, she won two Academy Awards for Best Actress: for Women in Love (1970) and A Touch of Class (1973). Jackson was born in Birkenhead on the Wirral, Merseyside where her father was a bricklayer.[2] Jackson was educated at the West Kirby County Grammar School for Girls, then worked for two years in a Boots chemist shop, before studying at RADA in Bloomsbury.[2] Having studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Jackson made her professional stage debut in Terence Rattigan\'s Separate Tables in 1957, and her film debut in This Sporting Life in 1963. Subsequently a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company for four years, she worked for director Peter Brook in several productions, including Peter Weiss\' Marat/Sade as Charlotte Corday. Jackson also appeared in the film version. Fame came with Jackson\'s starring role in the controversial Women in Love (1969) for which she won her first Academy Award for Best Actress, and another controversial role as Tchaikovsky\'s nymphomaniac wife in Ken Russell\'s The Music Lovers added to her image of being prepared to do almost anything for her art. She confirmed this by having her head shaved in order to play Queen Elizabeth I in the BBC\'s 1971 blockbuster serial, Elizabeth R. The series was later shown on PBS in the US and Jackson received two Emmy Awards for her work. She also portrayed Queen Elizabeth in the film Mary, Queen of Scots. She appeared on the Morecambe and Wise Show in 1971, playing Cleopatra in a comedy sketch. This led to many other appearances on the show, including the Christmas Shows of 1971 and 1972. In 1971 British exhibitors voted her the 6th most popular star at the British box office.[3] Filmmaker Melvin Frank saw her comedic potential and offered her the lead female role in his next project. She earned a second Academy Award for Best Actress for A Touch of Class (1973). Morecambe and Wise apparently sent her a telegram saying, "Stick with us kid, and we\'ll get you a third!"[citation needed] By then, she was recognised as one of Britain\'s leading actresses. In 1978, she was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She was one of the most fondly remembered later guest stars on The Muppet Show because she told the producers that she would perform any material they liked; this turned out to be a role where she has a delusion that she is a pirate captain who hijacks the Muppet Theatre as her ship. In 1989, she appeared in Ken Russell\'s The Rainbow, playing Anna Brangwen, mother of Gudrun, the part which had won her her first Academy Award. The Glenda Jackson Theatre, on the Borough Road campus of Wirral Metropolitan College, Birkenhead, was named after her in 1983.[4] It closed in 2003, and was demolished by Wirral Council, to make way for a new housing estate, in 2004.[5] Jackson retired from acting in order to enter the House of Commons in the 1992 general election as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate. After the 1997 general election, she was appointed a junior minister in the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair, with responsibility for London Transport, a post she resigned before an attempt to be nominated as the Labour Party candidate for the election of the first Mayor of London in 2000. The nomination was eventually won by Frank Dobson, who lost the election to Ken Livingstone, the independent candidate. In the 2005 general election, she received 14,615 votes, representing 38.29% of the votes cast in the constituency. As a high profile backbencher she became a regular critic of Blair over his plans to introduce top-up fees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She also called for him to resign following the Judicial Enquiry by Lord Hutton in 2003 surrounding the reasons for going to war in Iraq and the death of government adviser Dr. David Kelly. Jackson was generally considered to be a traditional left-winger, often disagreeing with the dominant Blairite governing Third Way faction in the Labour Party. By October 2005, her problems with Blair\'s leadership swelled to a point where she threatened to challenge the Prime Minister as a stalking horse candidate in a leadership contest if he did not stand down within a reasonable amount of time. On 31 October 2006, Jackson was one of 12 Labour MPs to back Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party\'s call for an inquiry into the Iraq War.[6] Her constituency boundaries changed for the 2010 general election. The Gospel Oak and Highgate wards became part of Holborn & St Pancras, and the new Hampstead & Kilburn constituency switched into Brent to include Brondesbury, Kilburn and Queens Park wards (from the old Brent East and Brent South seats). On 6 May 2010, Jackson was elected as the MP for the new Hampstead and Kilburn constituency with a margin of 42 votes over Conservative Chris Philp and Liberal Democrat Edward Fordham. She had the second closest result and second smallest majority of any MP in the 2010 election. In June 2011, Jackson announced that, presuming the Parliament elected in 2010 lasts until 2015, she would not seek re-election. She explained "I will be almost 80 and by then it will be time for someone else to have a turn".[7] In April 2013, Jackson gave a speech in parliament over discussion about the passing of Margaret Thatcher.[8] In a scathing speech criticising Thatcher\'s policies, she accused Thatcher of treating "vices as virtues" and stated that because of Thatcherism England was susceptible to unprecedented unemployment rates and homelessness.[9] Jackson has a son, Daniel, born in 1969 from her marriage to Roy Hodges. Dan Hodges is a Labour advisor and commentator.[10] She was five months pregnant when filming on Women in Love completed.[11] Her marriage to Hodges lasted from 1958 until their divorce in 1976.[12]'

aS'King of the Monsters is a series of video games created by SNK Corporation (the predecessor of the current SNK Playmore) for the Neo-Geo, featuring giant monsters reminiscent of kaiju and tokusatsu. King of the Monsters is a fighting/wrestling game. It was released by SNK on July 1, 1991 in Japan (later released on the Virtual Console), with later ports for the Super NES and Sega Genesis by Takara. King of the Monsters was included as part of SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 which was released for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP in 2008. Players get to choose any one of six monsters (four in the 16-bit ports) for battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together. Battles end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in which case the player loses). The game consists of 12 total levels: the player first must defeat all six monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then the player must defeat the six monsters again, in the same order, but this time in different cities. Mega criticised the game, awarding it a score of 10%, with Andy Dyer making the comment "unforgivably bad. There should be laws to protect us from crud like this".[1] The battles in King of the Monsters take place in six major Japanese cities (one for each monster): Tokyo, Kyoto, Kobe, Osaka, Okayama and Hiroshima. Almost everything in the stage (within the confines of the electrical barriers) can be destroyed. Vehicles such as helicopters, boats, and tanks can be picked up and thrown. On May 25, 1992, SNK and Takara released a sequel for the Neo-Geo. Takara also ported it to the Super NES in 1993. This sequel takes the original in a new direction by using three of the monsters from the original game as heroes in a side-scrolling beat \'em up. Geon, Astro Guy, and Woo are all upgraded to defend Earth against an alien threat led by a creature called Famardy. The game also features a 2-player competition mode. All the monsters had different names in the Japanese and American versions of the game. The Japanese cities of the first game have been abandoned in favor of more generic areas: American City, French City, Grand Canyon, Desert, Sea Bed, Volcano, and Hideout. A Genesis version of King of the Monsters 2 was developed by Betop and also released by Takara, but is somewhat different from the other two versions. Rather than being a beat \'em up, the Genesis version plays like a fighting game, similar to its predecessor. All characters (excluding Famardy) are playable and have all been given special attacks executed using standard fighting game motions. Players must destroy all other monsters, one after the other, without any of the scrolling stages in the Neo-Geo version and then defeat a clone of the player\'s monster. The King of the Monsters series was mostly forgotten following the second game. However, it briefly received some recognition in 2005, when SNK Playmore released Neo Geo Battle Coliseum, a fighting game featuring many of the company\'s popular characters. Cyber Woo is featured as one of the playable characters, although in a much smaller form and controlled by a human. Also, Yuki and Ai, two other characters in the game, have a combined attack where they can change into Atomic Guy for a brief period of time. The game also features 2 King of the Monsters stages (one day, one night) where you can see the skeleton of super Geon and a rusted old Cyber Woo locked in combat. Atomic Guy, Super Geon, and Cyber Woo appear as character cards in the DS game SNK vs Capcom: Card Fighters DS. Both Atomic Guy and Super Geon have their names transliterated directly from Japanese, so their names are spelled as, respectively, "Atomic Gai" and "Super Zion". In addition, King of the Monsters inclusion on SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1 led to many rare pieces of King of the Monsters production art being featured on the disc. King of the Monsters was a regular on the popular Nickelodeon game show Nick Arcade. It was almost always picked, leaving other games like ActRaiser, Super Ghouls \'n Ghosts, and El Viento out, this was the same on earlier broadcasts of Sky1 show Games World.'

aS'Samuel Wallis (23 April 1728  London 21 January 1795) was an English navigator who circumnavigated the world. Wallis was born near Camelford, Cornwall. In 1766 he was given the command of HMS Dolphin to circumnavigate the world, accompanied by the Swallow under the command of Philip Carteret. The two ships were parted shortly after sailing through the Strait of Magellan, Wallis continuing to Tahiti, which he named "King George the Third\'s Island" in honour of the King (June 1767). He continued to Batavia, where many of the crew died from dysentery, then via the Cape of Good Hope to England, arriving in May 1768. He was able to pass on useful information to James Cook who was due to depart shortly for the Pacific, and some of the crew from the Dolphin sailed with Cook. In 1780 Wallis was appointed Commissioner of the Admiralty. The Polynesian archipelago of Wallis and Futuna (now a French overseas collectivity) is named in his honour.'

aS'Northland Village Mall is a shopping centre in northwest Calgary, Alberta. Northland Village is a one level shopping centre with over 81 retail shops and services. It is located at the intersection of Crowchild Trail and Shaganappi Trail, in the neighbourhoods of Brentwood and Dalhousie and immediately north of the University of Calgary research park. The mall hosts the anchor stores Best Buy, Future Shop, and Wal-Mart; as well as other large format retailers including Winners, Fabricland, Home Outfitters, Home Furnishing, La-Z-Boy, Designer Depot and Kincaid. It is a regional mall with 510,000 square feet (47,000m2) of Gross leasable area.[1] Northland Village underwent renovations in 2005, when it hosted Calgary\'s first Designer Depot, the Hudson\'s Bay Co.\'s first off-price retail store location in Western Canada.[2] Other stores include Crown Optical, The Source, Stitches, Lenscrafters, Rogers Wireless, Bell Mobility, and Peoples Jewellers. The mall had an Eaton\'s department store location as one of its anchors until the late 1990s when the chain collapsed. The closure of Eaton\'s occurred at a time when it was spearheading a planned expansion and renovation at Northland Village; eventually, the now-vacated department store was converted into several stores, including Future Shop, Winners and Fabricland, with a small second level of the mall added in this area along with a modest parkade. In the mid-2000s, a further expansion saw the addition of Home Outfitters and Best Buy, despite the latter being owned by, and offering much the same products, as Future Shop just down the mall. In the late 1990s, a high-end grocery market ("Dubaji\'s") survived in the mall for only a couple of years before being replaced by a succession of furniture operations. In 2010, soon after the announcement that Target Canada would be opening stores in Canada, an anchor tenant called Target Apparel opened in the former grocery location, though some branding called it Target Canada. Like many Calgary malls, Northland Village had a Cineplex Odeon movie theatre for many years, before the trend became for theatres to vacate shopping centres for standalone facilities; Gold\'s Gym now occupies the former theatre site. It is the recipient of a 1998 MAXI Award [3] for their program to help the impoverished adults[4] As of early 2010, the mall has a number of noticeable vacancies, with at least one shop having left the mall in favour of CrossIron Mills. The situation remains unchanged as of early 2013.'

aS'Joseph Ewart (30 April l759  27 January 1792) was a Scottish diplomat. Ewart was born on 30 April l759, the eldest son of the minister of Troquear in the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. He was educated at Dumfries and at Edinburgh University, and then acted as travelling tutor to Macdonald of Clanronald. While abroad, Ewart made the acquaintance of Sir John Stepney, British minister at Dresden, and after that diplomat was transferred to Berlin, Ewart became his private secretary and then secretary of legation. After acting as charg d\'affaires from 1787 to 1788, he was appointed envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to the King of Prussia on 5 August 1788. Pitt\'s design, assisted by Lord Malmesbury, was to induce Frederick William of Prussia to intervene in the affairs of Holland; to put down the revolutionary party there; and to re-establish the Prince of Orange as a stadt-holder. This design was carried out, and Ewart obtained much credit for his share in the transactions. Of his subsequent conduct at the court of Berlin there are contradictory reports, for the French revolution commenced in 1789, and partisans and opponents of the English foreign policy of that period represent the minister\'s behaviour in different lights. Ewart was accused of adopting too peremptory an attitude towards the King of Prussia and his ministers, thus alienating them from England. He succeeded in concluding the marriage treaty between the Duke of York and the eldest daughter of the King of Prussia, and received warm acknowledgments from the king. His health breaking down, he resigned on a pension of 1,000l. a year and a promise of the Order of the Bath. He left Berlin on 3 November 1791. He died at his brother\'s house in Bladud\'s Buildings, Bath, on 27 January 1792, and was buried in Bath Abbey, where a tablet is eructed to his memory. A statement that he died out of his mind, and anothor (by Wraxell) that his death was due to foul play of the Empress Catherine, are entirely disproved by facts preserved in the family papers. In 1785 he married a daughter of Count Wontensleben, by whom he left one son (afterwards Lieutenant-general Ewart, C.B.) and two daughters.

aS'Lebowski Fest is an annual multi-city festival that began in 2002 in Louisville, Kentucky celebrating the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan\'s 1998 cult film, The Big Lebowski. The Festival\'s main event each year is a night of unlimited bowling with various contests including Costume, Trivia, Hardest and Farthest Travelled contests. Held over a weekend, events typically include a pre-fest party with bands the night before the bowling event as well as a "garden party" event (a day long outdoor party with bands, vendor booths, games) at the Louisville fest. Various celebrities from the film have attended some of the events, including Jeff Bridges. In 2005, Bridges showed up at a Lebowski Fest in Los Angeles singing and playing the film\'s theme song written by Bob Dylan, "The Man in Me". An account of the first ever Lebowski Fest is included in Mike Walsh\'s non-fiction account of his endeavor to bowl in all fifty U.S. states, Bowling Across America. An earlier, some claim first, incarnation of Lebowski Fest occurred in Bowling Green, Kentucky in February 2000. It was organized by film theory professor Dr. Ted Hovet and involved advertisements of the Dude saying the Bowling Alley really ties the campus together (it was in danger of closing). However, there is no connection between the two festivals. The Festival has also appeared on Ace of Cakes in the 5th series. The episode named \'The Big Cakeowski\' is centered around the severed toe cake that the Charm City Cakes staff create. The Festival is now in its tenth year and has been held in Louisville, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Austin, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, and most recently Portland, London and Boston. The organizers of Lebowski Fest: Bill Green (also graphic designer), Scott Shuffitt, Ben Peskoe, and Will Russell have also published the book, I\'m a Lebowski, You\'re a Lebowski: Life, The Big Lebowski, and What Have You, described as "a punch-drunk tribute worthy of a bowling-loving stoner named \'the Dude.\'"[1] There is also a documentary about Lebowski Fest, entitled The Achievers.[2] The British equivalent, inspired by Lebowski Fest, is known as The Dude Abides and is held in London.[3]'

aS"The Religious of Christian Education are a Roman Catholic religious institute of Religious Sisters founded for the education of girls in post-Revolutionary France. The Sisters were established by the Abb Louis Lafosse (17721839) and four young women, led by Mother Marie-Anne Dutertre, on 21 November 1817 in chauffour, Normandy.[1] Lafosse's vision, born from the destruction of the period of the French Revolution, was to provide the girls of the region a solid education, which was both humane and Christian.[2] The Bishop of Sez, Alexis Saussol, formally approved the congregation in 1821.[2] The Sisters quickly established communities throughout Normandy and the neighboring regions of France and Belgium. The anti-clerical laws passed in France in 1880 and again in 1904 led the Sisters to establish new foundations outside of the French-speaking world.[2] They established a community in Hampshire in the United Kingdom in 1889, and one in West Virginia, the United States, in 1905. In the United States, they later opened a number of communities in Massachusetts, where they served the children of French-Canadian immigrants. In December 1907, five women professed with Religious of Christian Education moved into a house in Asheville, NC at 48 Starnes Ave. They quickly established the Hillside Convent School in their home by January 6, 1908. [3] By September 1908, they operated the school in two houses located on North Main Street (now Broadway) and had an enrollment of 80 students, six of whom were boarding students. [4] In 1910, the school was moved to the former Victoria Inn on Victoria Road in Asheville and renamed St. Genevieve-of-the-Pines. Classes at the new campus started in January 1911. Initially it was both a day school for boys and girls aged 6-13, and a boarding school for girls aged 14-18. St. Genevieves College was added in 1912, offering a two-year course in French as well as a four-year liberal arts curriculum. In 1930 the school developed into a two-year college named St. Genevieves Junior College, which operated until 1955, when it became the School for Secretaries. The boys from the day school moved into a separate building in 1949, which became the Gibbons Hall School for Boys. At its height, the campus covered over 35 acres.[5] The Religious of Christian Education ceased operating the schools in 1971 due to a shortage of vocations and the age and poor health of the Sisters.[6] With the help of parents, the two schools merged to form St. Genevieve/Gibbons Hall School, an independent day school for both boys and girls, offering classes from kindergarten through the ninth grade, with some of the Sisters remaining as teachers. [7] To combat rising costs and declining enrollments at both schools, the school merged in 1987 with the Asheville Country Day School, at which time the Sisters withdrew from it. The St. Genevieve campus was sold to the Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College, and a new school, the Carolina Day School, was established on the Asheville Country Day School campus.[5] The Sisters established a school in Rabat, Morocco, in 1941. They opened a mission in the then-French colony of Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin) in 1958, which lasted until 2010.[8] Two schools were opened in Ireland in the early 1950s. After nearly 200 years of operation, the original motherhouse of the congregation in chauffour was closed in June 2011. This was due to the declining numbers of Sisters and the advanced age of most of them. The school they had operated from the time of their founding had already been closed in 1977.[9]"

aS"Gilles Mnage (August 15, 1613 July 23, 1692) was a French scholar. He was born at Angers, the son of Guillaume Mnage, king's advocate at Angers. A good memory and enthusiasm for learning carried him quickly through his literary and professional studies, and he practised at the bar at Angers before he was twenty. In 1632, he pleaded several causes before the parlement of Paris. Illness caused him to abandon the legal profession for the church. He became prior of Montdidier without taking holy orders, and lived for some years in the household of Cardinal de Retz (then coadjutor to the Archbishop of Paris), where he had leisure for literary pursuits. Some time after 1648, he quarrelled with his patron and withdrew to a house in the cloister of Notre-Dame de Paris, where he gathered round him on Wednesday evenings those literary assemblies which he called Mercuriales. Jean Chapelain, Paul Pellisson, Valentine Conrart, Jean Franois Sarrazin and Du Bos were among the habitus. He was tutor to Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette, later the great writer, to whom he was very attached. He was admitted to the Accademia della Crusca of Florence, but his caustic sarcasm led to his exclusion from the Acadmie franaise. Mnage made many enemies and suffered under the satire of Boileau and of Molire. Molire immortalized him as the pedant Vadius in Les Femmes savantes, a portrait Mnage pretended to ignore. In 1664 he published at London an edition of the Lives of Eminent Philosophers by Diogenes Laertius that contains an unedited anonymous life of Aristotle; this life was known as 'Vita Menagiana' before the critical edition by Ingemar Dring, Aristotle in the ancient biographical tradition Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell 1957; reprinted New York, Garland, 1987, pp.8093) with the title 'Vita Hesychii' (the attribution to Hesychius of Miletus is controversial). Mnage died at Paris in 1692. After his death his friends published, under the title of Menagiana, a collection of his witticisms and table talk. The edition of this collection by La Monnoye (2 vols., 1693/4) has found favor.[1]"

aS'The Golden-hooded Tanager (Tangara larvata) is a medium-sized passerine bird. This tanager is a resident breeder from southern Mexico south to western Ecuador. Adult Golden-hooded Tanagers are 13cm long and weigh 19g. The adult male has a golden head with a black eyemask edged with violet blue above and below. The upperparts of the body are black apart from the turquoise shoulders, rump and edgings of the wings and tail. The flanks are blue and the central belly is white. Females have a greenish tinge to the head, sometimes with black speckling on the crown, and more extensively white underparts. Immatures are duller, with a green head, dark grey upperparts, off-white underparts, and little blue in the plumage. The Golden-hooded Tanagers call is a sharp tsit and the song is a tuneless rattled series of tick sounds. It resides from sea level to 1500m altitude in the canopy of dense forests and semi-open areas like clearings, second growth and well-vegetated gardens. Golden-hooded Tanagers occur in pairs, family groups, or as part of a mixed-species feeding flock. They eat certain small fruit,[2] usually swallowed whole, and insects are also taken. The cup nest is built in a tree fork or in a bunch of green bananas, and the normal clutch is two brown-blotched white eggs. This species is often double-brooded, and the young birds from the first clutch assist with feeding the second brood of chicks.'

aS'Black-figure pottery painting, also known as the black-figure style or black-figure ceramic (Greek, , melanomorpha) is one of the styles of painting on antique Greek vases. It was especially common between the 7th and 5th centuries BC, although there are specimens dating as late as the 2nd century BC. Stylistically it can be distinguished from the preceding orientalizing period and the subsequent red-figure pottery style. Figures and ornaments were painted on the body of the vessel using shapes and colors reminiscent of silhouettes. Delicate contours were incised into the paint before firing, and details could be reinforced and highlighted with opaque colors, usually white and red. The principal centers for this style were initially the commercial hub Corinth, and later Athens. Other important production sites are known to have been in Laconia, Boeotia, eastern Greece and Italy. Particularly in Italy individual styles developed which were at least in part intended for the Etruscan market. Greek black-figure vases were very popular with the Etruscans, as is evident from frequent imports. Greek artists created customized goods for the Etruscan market which differed in form and decor from their normal products. The Etruscans also developed their own black-figure ceramic industry oriented on Greek models. Black-figure painting on vases was the first art style to give rise to a significant number of identifiable artists. Some are known by their true names, others only by the pragmatic names they were given in the scientific literature. Especially Attica was the home of well-known artists. Some potters introduced a variety of innovations which frequently influenced the work of the painters; sometimes it was the painters who inspired the potters originality. Red- as well as black-figure vases are one of the most important sources of mythology and iconography, and sometimes also for researching day-to-day ancient Greek life. Since the 19th century at the latest, these vases have been the subject of intensive investigation. The foundation for pottery painting is the image carrier, in other words, the vase onto which an image is painted. Popular shapes alternated with passing fashions. Whereas many recurred after intervals, others were replaced over time. But they all had a common method of manufacture: after the vase was made, it was first dried before being painted. The workshops were under the control of the potters, who as owners of businesses had an elevated social position[citation needed]. The extent to which potters and painters were identical is uncertain. It is likely that many master potters themselves made their main contribution in the production process as vase painters, while employing additional painters. It is, however, not easy to reconstruct links between potters and painters. In many cases, such as Tleson and the Tleson Painter, Amasis and the Amasis Painter or even Nikosthenes and Painter N, it is impossible to make unambiguous attributions, although in much of the scientific literature these painters and potters are assumed to be the same person. But such attributions can only be made with confidence if the signatures of potter and painter are at hand. The painters, who were either slaves or craftsmen paid as pottery painters, worked on unfired. leather-dry vases. In the case of black-figure production, the subject was painted on the vase with a clay slurry (a glossy slip, in older literature also designated as varnish) which turned black after firing. This was not a "color" in the traditional sense, since this surface slip was of the same material as the vase itself, only differing in the size of the component particles. The area for the figures was first painted with a brush-like implement. The internal outlines and structural details were incised into the slip so that the underlying clay could be seen through the scratches. Two other earth-based pigments were used to add detailsred and white for ornaments, clothing or parts of clothing, hair, animal manes, parts of weapons and other equipment. White was also frequently used to represent womens skin. The success of all this effort could only be judged after a complicated, three-phase firing process which generated the red color of the vase clay and the black of the applied slip. Specifically, the vessel was fired in a kiln at a temperature of about 800C, with the resultant oxidization turning the vase a reddish-orange color. The temperature was then raised to about 950C with the kiln\'s vents closed and green wood added to remove the oxygen. The vessel then turned an overall black. The final stage required the vents to be re-opened to allow oxygen into the kiln, which was allowed to cool down. The vessel then returned to its reddish-orange colour due to renewed oxidization, while the now-sintered painted layer remained the glossy black color which had been created in the second stage. Although scoring is one of the main stylistic indicators, some pieces do without. For these, the form is technically similar to the orientalizing style, but the image repertoire no longer reflects orientalizing practice.[1] The evolution of black-figure pottery painting is traditionally described in terms of various regional styles and schools. Using Corinth as the hub, there were basic differences in the productions of the individual regions, even if they did influence each other. Especially in Attica, although not exclusively there, the best and most influential artists of their time characterized classical Greek pottery painting. The further development and quality of the vessels as image carrier are the subjects of this section. The black-figure technique was developed around 700 BC in Corinth[2] and used for the first time in the early 7th century BC by Proto-Corinthian pottery painters, who were still painting in the orientalizing style. The new technique was reminiscent of engraved metal pieces, with the more costly metal tableware being replaced by pottery vases with figures painted on them. A characteristic black-figure style developed before the end of the century. Most orientalizing elements had been given up and there were no ornaments except for dabbed rosettes (the rosettes being form by an arrangement of small individual dots) The clay used in Corinth was soft, with a yellow, occasionally green tint. Faulty firing was a matter of course, occurring whenever the complicated firing procedure did not function as desired. The result was often unwanted coloring of the entire vase, or parts of it. After firing, the glossy slip applied to the vase turned dull black. The supplemental red and white colors first appeared in Corinth and then became very common. The painted vessels are usually of small format, seldom higher than 30cm. Oil flasks (alabastra, aryballos), pyxides, kraters, oenochoes and cups were the most common vessels painted. Sculptured vases were also widespread. In contrast to Attic vases, inscriptions are rare, and painters signatures even more so. Most of the surviving vessels produced in Corinth have been found in Etruria, lower Italy and Sicily. In the 7th and first half of the 6th centuries BC, Corinthian vase painting dominated the Mediterranean market for ceramics. It is difficult to construct a stylistic sequence for Corinthian vase painting. In contrast to Attic painting, for example, the proportions of the pottery foundation did not evolve much. It is also often difficult to date Corinthian vases; one frequently has to rely on secondary dates, such as the founding of Greek colonies in Italy. Based on such information an approximate chronology can be drawn up using stylistic comparisons, but it seldom has anywhere near the precision of the dating of Attic vases. Mythological scenes are frequently depicted, especially Heracles and figures relating to the Trojan War. But the imagery on Corinthian vases does not have as wide a thematic range as do later works by Attic painters. Gods are seldom depicted, Dionysus never. But the Theban Cycle was more popular in Corinth than later in Athens. Primarily fights, horsemen and banquets were the most common scenes of daily life, the latter appearing for the first time during the early Corinthian period. Sport scenes are rare. Scenes with fat-bellied dancers are unique and their meaning is disputed up to the present time. These are drinkers whose bellies and buttocks are padded with pillows and they may represent an early form of Greek comedy.[3] The transitional style (640-625 BC) linked the orientalizing (Proto-Corinthian) with the black-figure style. The old animal frieze style of the Proto-Corinthian period had run dry, as did the interest of vase painters in mythological scenes. During this period animal and hybrid creatures were dominant. The index form of the time was the spherical aryballos, which was produced in large numbers and decorated with animal friezes or scenes of daily life. The image quality is inferior compared with the orientalizing period. The most distinguished artists of the time were the Shambling Bull Painter, whose most famous work is an aryballos with a hunting scene, the Painter of Palermo 489, and his disciple, the Columbus Painter. The latters personal style can be most easily recognized in his images of powerful lions. Beside the aryballos, the kotyle and the alabastron are the most important vase shapes. The edges of kotyles were ornamented, and the other decorations consisted of animals and rays. The two vertical vase surfaces frequently have mythological scenes. The alabastrons were usually painted with single figures. The most important early Corinthian painter (625-600 BC)[4] was the Duel Painter, who depicted fighting scenes on aryballos. Starting in the Mid-Corinthian period (600-575 BC), opaque colors were used more and more frequently to emphasize details. Figures were additionally painted using a series of white dots. The aryballos became larger and were given a flat base. The Pholoe Painter is well known, his most famous work being a skyphos with a picture of Heracles. The Dodwell Painter continued to paint animal friezes although other painters had already given up this tradition.[5] His creative period extended into Late-Corinthian times and his influence on vase painting of that time cannot be overestimated. Likewise of exceptional reputation were the master of the Gorgoneion Group and the Cavalcade Painter, given this designation because of his preference for depicting horsemen on cup interiors; he was active around 580 BC.[6] Two of his masterpieces[7] are a cup[8] showing the suicide of Ajax and a column krater showing a bridal couple in a chariot. All figures shown on the bowl are labeled. The first artist known by his name is the polychrome vase painter Timonidas, who signed[9] a flask[10] and a pinax.[11] A second artists name, Milonidas, also appears on a pinax. The Corinthian olpe was replaced by an Attic version of the oinochoe with a cloverleaf lip. In Middle Corinthian time depictions of people again became more common. The Eurytios krater, dated around 600 BC, is considered to be of particularly high quality; it shows a symposium in the main frieze with Heracles, Eurytios and other mythical figures. In Late Corinthian times (sometimes designated Late Corinthian I, 575-550 BC) Corinthian vases had a red coating to enhance the contrast between the large white areas and the rather pale color of the clay vessel. This put the Corinthian craftsmen in competition with Attic pottery painters, who had in the meantime taken over a leading role in the pottery trade. Attic vase forms were also increasingly copied. Oinochoes, whose form had remained basically unchanged up until that time, began to resemble Attic forms; lekythos also started to be increasingly produced. The column krater, a Corinthian invention which was for that reason called a korinthios in the rest of Greece, was modified. Shortening the volutes above the handles gave rise to the Chalcidic krater. The main image field it was decorated with various representations of daily life or mythological scenes, the secondary field contained an animal frieze. The back often showed two large animals. Cups had become deeper already in Mid-Corinthian times and this trend continued. They became just as popular as kotyles. Many of them have mythological scenes on the outside and a gorgon grimace on the inside. This type of painting was also adopted by Attic painters. On their part, Corinthian painters took over framed image fields from Athens. Animal friezes became less important. During this time the third Corinthian painter with a known name, Chares, was active.[12] The Tydeus Painter should also be mentioned, who around 560 BC liked to paint neck amphoras with a red background.[13] Incised rosettes continued to be put on vases; they are lacking on only a few kraters and cups. The most outstanding piece of art in this period is the Amphiaraos krater, a column krater created around 560 BC as the major work of the Amphiaraos Painter. It shows several events from the life of the hero Amphiaraos. Around 550 BC the production of figured vases came to an end. The following Late Corinthian Style II is characterized by vases only with ornaments, usually painted with a silhouette technique. It was succeeded by the red-figure style, which however did not attain a particularly high quality in Corinth. With over 20,000 extant pieces, Attic black-figure vases comprise the largest and at the same time most significant vase collection, second only to Attic red-figure vases.[14] Attic potters benefitted from the excellent, iron-rich clay found in Attica. High quality Attic black-figure vases have a uniform, glossy, pitch-black coating and the color-intensive terra cotta clay foundation has been meticulously smoothened. Womens skin is always indicated with a white opaque color, which is also frequently used for details such as individual horses, clothing or ornaments. The most outstanding Attic artists elevated vase painting to a graphic art, but a large number of average quality and mass-market products were also produced. The outstanding significance of Attic pottery comes from their almost endless repertoire of scenes covering a wide range of themes. These provide rich testimonials especially in regard to mythology, but also to daily life. On the other hand, there are virtually no images referring to contemporary events. Such references are only occasionally evident in the form of annotations, for example when kalos inscriptions are painted on a vase. Vases were produced for the domestic market on the one hand, and were important for celebrations or in connection with ritual acts. On the other hand they were also an important export product sold throughout the Mediterranean area. For this reason most of the surviving vases come from Etruscan necropolises.[15] The black-figure technique was first applied in the middle of the 7th century BC, during the period of Proto-Attic vase painting. Influenced by pottery from Corinth, which offered the highest quality at the time, Attic vase painters switched to the new technology between about 635 BC and the end of the century. At first they closely followed the methods and subjects of the Corinthian models. The Painter of Berlin A 34 at the beginning of this period is the first identified individual painter. The first artist with a unique style was the Nessos Painter. With his Nessos amphora he created the first outstanding piece in the Attic black-figure style.[16] At the same time he was an early master of the Attic animal frieze style. One of his vases was also the first known Attic vase exported to Etruria.[17] He was also responsible for the first representations of harpies and Sirens in Attic art. In contrast to the Corinthian painters he used double and even triple incised lines to better depict animal anatomy. A double-scored shoulder line became a characteristic of Attic vases. The possibilities inherent in large pieces of pottery such as belly amphoras as carriers for images were also recognized at an early date. Other important painters of this pioneer time were the Piraeus Painter, the Bellerophon Painter and the Lion Painter. The black-figure style became generally established in Athens around 600 BC. An early Athenian development was the horse-head amphora, the name coming from the depiction of horse heads in an image window. Image windows were frequently used in the subsequent period and were later adopted even in Corinth. The Cerameicus Painter and the Gorgon Painter are associated with the horse-head amphoras. The Corinthian influence was not only maintained, but even intensified. The animal frieze was recognized as generally obligatory and customarily used. This had economic as well as stylistic reasons, because Athens competed with Corinth for markets. Attic vases were sold in the Black Sea area, Libya, Syria, lower Italy and Spain, as well as within the Greek homeland. In addition to following Corinthian models, Athens vases also showed local innovations. Thus at the beginning of the 6th century BC a "Deianaira type" of lekythos arose, with an elongated, oval form.[18] The most important painter of this early time was the Gorgon Painter (600-580 BC). He was a very productive artist who seldom made use of mythological themes or human figures, and when he did, always accompanied them with animals or animal friezes. Some of his other vases had only animal representations, as was the case with many Corinthian vases. Besides the Gorgon Painter the painters of the Komast Group (585-570 BC) should be mentioned. This group decorated types of vases which were new to Athens, namely lekanes, kotyles and kothons. The most important innovation was however the introduction of the komast cup, which along with the "prekomast cups" of the Oxford Palmette Class stands at the beginning of the development of Attic cups. Important painters in this group were the elder KX Painter and the somewhat less talented KY Painter, who introduced the column krater to Athens.[19] These vessels were designed for use at banquets and were thus decorated with relevant komos scenes, such as komast performers komos scenes. Other significant painters of the first generation were the Panther Painter, the Anagyrus Painter, the Painter of the Dresden Lekanis and the Polos Painter. The last significant representative of the first generation of painters was Sophilos (580570 BC), who is the first Attic vase painter known by name. In all, he signed four surviving vases, three as painter and one as potter, revealing that at this date potters were also painters of vases in the black-figure style. A fundamental separation of both crafts seems to have occurred only in the course of the development of the red-figure style, although prior specialization cannot be ruled out. Sophilos makes liberal use of annotations. He apparently specialized in large vases, since especially dinos and amphoras are known to be his work. Much more frequently than his predecessors, Sophilos shows mythological scenes like the funeral games for Patroclus. The decline of the animal frieze begins with him, and plant and other ornaments are also of lower quality since they are regarded as less important and thus receive scant attention from the painter. But in other respects Sophilos shows that he was an ambitious artist. On two dinos the marriage of Peleus and Thetis is depicted. These vases were produced at about the same time as the Franois vase, which depicts this subject to perfection. However, Sophilos does without any trimmings in the form of animal friezes on one of his two dinos,[20] and he does not combine different myths in scenes distributed over various vase surfaces. It is the first large Greek vase showing a single myth in several interrelated segments. A special feature of the dinos is the painters application of the opaque white paint designating women women directly on the clay foundation, and not as usual on the black gloss. The figures interior details and contours are painted in a dull red. This particular technique is rare, only found in vases painted in Sophilos workshop and on wooden panels painted in the Corinthian style in the 6th century BC. Sophilos also painted one of the rare chalices (a variety of goblet) and created the first surviving series of votive tablets. He himself or one of his successors also decorated the first marriage vase (known as a lebes gamikos)to be found.[21] Starting around the second third of the 6th century BC, Attic artists became interested in mythological scenes and other representations of figures. Animal friezes became less important. Only a few painters took care with them, and they were generally moved from the center of attention to less important areas of vases. This new style is especially represented by the Franois vase, signed by both the potter Ergotimos and the painter Kleitias (570560 BC). This krater is considered to be the most famous Greek painted vase.[22] It is the first known volute krater made of clay. Mythological events are depicted in several friezes, with animal friezes being shown in secondary locations. Several iconographic and technical details appear on this vase for the first time. Many are unique, such as the representation of a lowered mast of a sailing ship; others became part of the standard repertoire, such as people sitting with one leg behind the other, instead of with the traditional parallel positioning of the legs.[23] Four other, smaller vases were signed by Ergotimos and Kleitias, and additional vases and fragments are attributed to them. They provide evidence for other innovations by Kleitias, like the first depiction of the birth of Athena or of the Dance on Crete. Nearchos (565555 BC) signed as potter and painter. He favored large figures and was the first to create images showing the harnessing of a chariot. Another innovation was to place a tongue design on a white background under the vase lip.[24] Other talented painters were the Painter of Akropolis 606 and the Ptoon Painter, whose most well-known piece is the Hearst Hydria. The Burgon Group is also significant, being the source of the first totally preserved Panathenaic amphora. The Siana cup evolved from the komast cup around 575 BC. While the Komast Group produced shapes other than cups, some craftsmen specialized in cup production after the time of the first important exemplifier of Siana cups, the C Painter (575-555 BC). The cups have a higher rim than previously and a trumpet-shaped base on a relatively short hollow stem. For the first time in Attic vase painting the inside of the cup was decorated with framed images (tondo). There were two types of decoration. In the "double-decker" style the cup body and the lip each have separate decorations. In the "overlap" style the image extends over both body and lip. After the second quarter of the 6th century BC there was more interest in decorating especially cups with pictures of athletes. Another important Siana cup painter was the Heidelberg Painter. He, too, painted almost exclusively Siana cups. His favorite subject was the hero Heracles. The Heidelberg Painter is the first Attic painter to show him with the Erymanthian boar, with Nereus, with Busiris and in the garden of the Hesperides. The Cassandra Painter, who decorated mid-sized cups with high bases and lips, marks the end of the development of the Siana cup. He is primarily significant as the first known painter to belong to the so-called Little Masters, a large group of painters who produced the same range of vessels, known as Little-master cups. So-called Merrythought cups were produced contemporaneously with Siana cups. Their handles are in the form of a two-pronged fork and end in what looks like a button. These cups do not have a delineated rim. They also have a deeper bowl with a higher and narrower foot. The last outstanding painter of the Pre-Classical Archaic Period was Lydos (560-540 BC), who signed two of his surviving pieces with ho Lydos (the Lydian). He or his immediate ancestors probably came from Asia Minor but he was undoubtedly trained in Athens. Over 130 surviving vases are now attributed to him. One of his pictures on a hydria is the first known Attic representation of the fight between Heracles and Geryon. Lydos was the first to show Heracles with the hide of a lion, which afterward became common in Attic art. He also depicted the battle between the gods and the giants on a dinos found on Athens acropolis, and Heracles with Cycnus. Lydos decorated other types of vessels besides hydriai and dinos, such as plates, cups (overlap Siena cups), column kraters and psykters, as well as votive tablets. It continues to be difficult to identify Lydos products as such since they frequently differ only slightly from those of his immediate milieu. The style is quite homogenous, but the pieces vary considerably in quality. The drawings are not always carefully produced. Lydos was probably a foreman in a very productive workshop in Athenspottery district. He was presumably the last Attic vase painter to put animal friezes on large vases. Still in the Corinthian tradition, his figure drawings are a link in the chain of vase painters extending from Kleitias via Lydos and the Amasis Painters to Exekias. Along with them he participated in the evolution of this art in Attica and had a lasting influence.[25] A special form of Attic vases of this period was the Tyrrhenian amphora (550-530 BC). These were egg-shaped neck amphora with decorations atypical of the usual Attic design canon of the period. Almost all of the c. 200 surviving vases were found in Etruria. The body of the amphora is usually subdivided into several parallel friezes. The upper or shoulder frieze usually shows a popular scene from mythology. There are sometimes less common subjects, such as a unique scene of the sacrificing of Polyxena. The first known erotic images on Attic vases are also found at this vase location. The painters frequently put annotations on Tyrrhenian amphora which identify the persons shown. The other two or three friezes were decorated with animals; sometimes one of them was replaced with a plant frieze. The neck is customarily painted with a lotus palmette cross or festoons. The amphoras are quite colorful and recall Corinthian products. In this case a Corinthian form was obviously deliberately copied to produce a particular vase type for the Etruscan market, where the style was popular. It is possible that this form was not manufactured in Athens but somewhere else in Attica, or even outside Attica. Important painters were the Castellani Painter and the Goltyr Painter. The period between 560 and the inception of red-figure pottery painting around 530/520 BC is considered to be the absolute pinnacle of black-figure vase painting. In this period the best and most well-known artists exploited all the possibilities offered by this style.[26] The first important painter of this time was the Amasis Painter (560525 BC), named after the famous potter Amasis, with whom he primarily worked. Many researchers regard them as the same person. He began his painting career at about the same time as Lydos but was active over a period almost twice as long. Whereas Lydos showed more the abilities of a skilled craftsman, the Amasis Painter was an accomplished artist. His images are clever, charming and sophisticated[27] and his personal artistic development comes close to a reflection of the overall evolution of black-figure Attic vase painting at that time. His early work shows his affinity to the painters of Siana cups. Advances can be most easily recognized in how he draws the folds of clothing. His early female figures wear clothes without folds. Later he paints flat, angular folds, and in the end he is able to convey the impression of supple, flowing garments.[28] Drawings of garments were one of his chief characteristics; he liked to depicted pattered and fringed clothing. The groups of figures which the Amasis Painter shows were carefully drawn and symmetrically composed. Initially they were quite static, later figures convey an impression of motion. Although the Amasis Painter often depicted mythological eventshe is known for his pig-faced satyrs, for examplehe is better known for his scenes of daily life. He was the first painter to portray them to a significant extent. His work decisively influenced the work of red-figure painters later. He possibly anticipated some of their innovations or was influenced by them toward the end of his painting career: on many of his vases women are only shown in outline, without a black filling, and they are no longer identifiable as women by the application of opaque white as skin color.[29] Group E (550525 v. Chr.) was a large, self-contained collection of artisans, and is considered to be the most important anonymous group producing black-figure Attic pottery. It rigorously broke with the stylistic tradition of Lydos both as to image and vessel. Egg-shaped neck amphoras were completely given up, column kraters almost entirely abandoned. Instead, this group introduced Type A belly amphoras, which then became an index form. Neck amphoras were usually produced only in customized versions. The group had no interest in small formats. Many scenes, especially those originating in myths, were reproduced again and again. Thus several amphoras of this group show Heracles with Geryon or the Nemean Lion, and increasingly Theseus and the Minotaur, as well as the birth of Athena. The particular significance of the group is, however, in the influence it exerted on Exekias. Most Attic artists of the period copied the styles of Group E and Exekias. The work of Lydos and the Amasis Painter was, by contrast, not imitated as frequently. Beazley describes the importance of the group for Exekias as follows: "Group E is the fertile ground from which the art of Exekias sprouts, the tradition which he takes up and surpasses on his way from an excellent craftsman to a true artist".[30] Exekias (545-520 BC) is generally considered to be the absolute master of the black-figure style, which reaches its apex with him.[31] His significance is not only due to his masterful vase painting, but also to his high quality and innovative pottery. He signed 12 of his surviving vessels as potter, two as both painter and potter. Exekias probably had a large role in the development of Little-master cups and the Type A belly amphora mentioned above, and he possibly invented the calyx krater, at least the oldest existing piece is from his workshop. In contrast to many other comparable craftsmen, as a painter he attached great importance to the careful elaboration of ornaments. The details of his imageshorses manes, weapons, clothingare also outstandingly well executed. His scenes are usually monumental and the figures emanate a dignity previously unknown in painting. In many cases he broke with Attic conventions. For his most famous vessel, the Dionysus cup, he was the first to use a coral-red interior coating instead of the customary red color. This innovation, as well as his placing of two pairs of eyes on the exterior, connects Exekias with the classic eye cups. Probably even more innovative was his use of the entire inside of the cup for his picture of Dionysus, reclining on a ship from which grapevines sprout. At this time it was in fact customary to decorate the inside surface merely with a gorgon face. The cup[32] is probably one of the experiments undertaken in the pottery district to break new ground before the red-figure style was introduced. He was the first to paint a ship sailing along the rim of a dinos. He only seldom adhered to traditional patterns of depicting customary mythological subjects. His depiction of the suicide of Ajax is also significant. Exekias does not show the act itself, which was in the tradition, but rather Ajax preparations.[33] About as famous as the Dionysus cup is an amphora with his visualization of Ajax and Achilles engaged in a board game.[34] Not only is the portrayal detailed, Exekias even conveys the outcome of the game. Almost in the style of a speech balloon he has both players announce the numbers they cast with their diceAjax a three and Achilles a four. This is the oldest known depiction of this scene, of which there is no mention in classical literature. No fewer than 180 other surviving vases, dating from the Exekias version up to about 480 BC, show this scene.[35] John Boardman emphasizes the exceptional status of Exekias which singles him out from traditional vase painters: "The people depicted by earlier artist are elegant dolls at best. Amasis (the Amasis Painter) was able to visualize people as people. But Exekias could envision them as gods and thereby give us a foretaste of classical art".[36] Acknowledging that vase painters in ancient Greece were regarded as craftsmen rather than artists, Exekias is nevertheless considered by todays art historians to be an accomplished artist whose work can be compared with "major" paintings (murals and panel paintings) of that period.[37] His contemporaries apparently recognized this as well. The Berlin Collection of Classical Antiquities in the Altes Museum contains the remnants of a series of his votive tablets. The complete series probably had 16 individual panels. Placing such an order with a potter and vase painter is likely to be unique in antiquity and is evidence of the high reputation of this artist. The tablets show grieving for a dead Athenian woman as well as her lying in state and being transported to a gravesite. Exekias conveys both the grief and the dignity of the figures. One special feature, for example, is that the leader of the funeral procession turns his face to look at the viewer directly, so to speak. The depiction of the horses is also unique; they have individual temperaments and are not reduced to their function as noble animals, as is otherwise customary on vases.[38] There was further specialization among producers of vessels and cups during the mature Classical Period. The large-volume komast and Siana cups evolved via Gordion cups[39] into graceful variants called Little-master cups because of their delicate painting. The potters and painters of this form are accordingly called Little Masters. They chiefly painted band cups and lip cups. The lip cups[40] got their name from their relatively pronounced and delineated lip. The outside of the cup retained much of the clay background and typically bore only a few small images, sometimes only inscriptions, or in some cases the entire cup was only minimally decorated. Also in the area of the handles there are seldom more than palmettes or inscriptions near the attachment points. These inscriptions can be the potters signature, a drinkers toast, or simply a meaningless sequence of letters. But lip cup interiors are often also decorated with images. Band cups[41] have a softer transition between the body and the rim. The decoration is in the form of a band circling the cup exterior and can frequently be a very elaborate frieze. In the case of this form the rim is coated with a glossy black slip. The interior retains the color of the clay, except for a black dot painted in the center. Variations include Droop cups and Kassel cups. Droop cups[42] have black, concave lips and a high foot. As with classic band cups the rim is left black, but the area below it is decorated with ornaments like leaves, buds, palmettes, dots, nimbuses or animals on the cup exterior. Kassel cups[43] are a small form, squatter than other Little Masters cups, and the entire exterior is decorated. As in the case of Droop cups, primarily ornaments are painted. Famous Little Masters are the potters Phrynos, Sokles, Tleson and Ergoteles, the latter two being sons of the potter Nearchos. Hermogenes invented a Little Master variety of skyphos[44] now known as a Hermogenes skyphos. The Phrynos Painter, Taleides Painter, Xenokles Painter and the Group of Rhodes 12264 should also be mentioned here. Lip cup by the potter Tleson with signature ("Tleson, son of nearchos, made me"), c. 540 BC, now in the Munich State Collection of Antiquities Band cup by an unknown artist showing fighters, c. 540 BC, from Vulci, now in the Louvre, Paris Droop cup by an unknown artist, c. 550/530 BC, from Greece, now in the Louvre, Paris Kassel cup by an unknown artist, c. 540 BC, now in the Louvre, Paris Until the end of the century the quality of black-figure vase production could basically be maintained. But after the development of the red-figure style around 530 BC, presumably by the Andokides Painter, more and more painters went over to the red-figure style, which provided many more possibilities for adding details within the figure contours. The new style also permitted many more promising experiments with foreshortening, perspective views and new designs for arrangements. Scene contents, as always, reflected trends in taste and the spirit of the times, but the red-figure style created better preconditions for presenting more elaborate scenes by exploiting the new arrangement possibilities. But in the meantime, a few innovative craftsmen could still give new impulses to the production of black-figure vases. The most imaginative potter of the time, also a talented businessman, was Nikosthenes. Over 120 vases bear his signature, indicating that they were made by him or in his workshop. He seems to have particularly specialized in producing vases for export to Etruria. In his workshop the usual neck amphoras, Little Masters, Droop and eye cups were produced, but also a type of amphora reminiscent of Etruscan bucchero pottery, named the Nikosthenic amphora after its creator. These pieces were found particularly in Caere, the other vase types usually in Cerveteri and Vulci. The many inventions in his workshop were not limited to forms. In Nikosthenes workshop what is known as the Sixs technique was developed, in which figures were painted in reddish brown or white atop a black glossy slip. It is not clear whether Nikosthenes also painted vases, in which case he is usually presumed to be identical with Painter N.[45] The BMN Painter and the red-figure Nikosthenes Painter are also named after Nikosthenes. In his workshop he employed many famous vase painters, including the elderly Lydos, Oltos and Epiktetos. The workshop tradition was continued by Nikosthenes successor, Pamphaios.[46] Two black-figure vase painters are considered to be mannerists (540-520 BC). The painter Elbows Out decorated primarily Little Masters cups. The extended elbows of his figures are conspicuous, a characteristic responsible for his pragmatic name. He only seldom depicted mythological scenes; erotic scenes are much more common. He also decorated a rare vase form known as a lydion. The most important of the two painters was The Affecter, whose name comes from the exaggeratedly artificial impression made by his figures. These small-headed figures do not seem to be acting as much as posing. His early work shows scenes of daily life; later he turned to decorative scenes in which figures and attributes are recognizable, but hardly actions. If his figures are clothed they look as if they were padded; if they are naked they are very angular. The Affecter was both potter and painter; over 130 of his vases have survived.[47] The Antimenes Painter (530500 BC) liked to decorate hydria with animal friezes in the predella, and otherwise especially neck amphoras. Two hydria attributed to him are decorated on the neck region using a white ground technique. He was the first to paint amphoras with a masklike face of Dionysus. The most famous of his over 200 surviving vases shows an olive harvest on the back side. His drawings are seldom really precise, but neither are they excessively careless.[48] Stylistically, the painter Psiax is closely related to the Antimenes Painter, although the former also used the red-figure technique. As the teacher of the painters Euphronius and Phintias, Psiax had a great influence on the early development of the red-figure style. He frequently shows horse and chariot scenes and archers.[49] The last important group of painters was the Leagros Group (520-500 BC), named after the kalos inscription they frequently used, Leagros. Amphoras and hydria, the latter often with palmettes in the predella, are the most frequently painted vessels. The image field is usually filled absolutely to capacity, but the quality of the images is still kept very high. Many of the over 200 vases in this group were decorated with scenes of the Trojan War and the life of Heracles[50] Painters like the witty Acheloos Painter, the conventional Chiusi Painter, and the Daybreak Painter with his faithful detailing belong to the Leagros Group.[51] Other well-known vase painters of the time are the Painter of the Vatican Mourner, The Princeton Painter, the Painter of Munich 1410 and the Swing Painter (540-520 BC), to whom many vases are attributed. He is not considered to be a very good artist, but his figures are unintentionally humorous because of the figures with their large heads, strange noses and frequently clenched fists.[52] The work of the Rycroft Painter bears a resemblance to red-figure vase painting and the new forms of expression. He liked to depict Dionysian scenes, horses and chariots, and the adventures of Heracles. He often uses outline drawings. The approximately 50 usually large-size vessels attributed to him are elegantly painted.[53] The Class of C.M. 218 primarily decorated variations of the Nikosthenic amphoras. The Hypobibazon Class worked with a new type of belly amphora with rounded handles and feet, whose decoration is characterized by a key meander above the image fields. A smaller variant of neck amphora was decorated by the Three Line Group. The Perizoma Group adopted around 520 BC the newly introduced form of the stamnos. Toward the end of the century, high quality productions were still being produced by the Euphiletos Painter, the Madrid Painter and the imaginative Priam Painter. Particularly cup painters like Oltos, Epiktetos, Pheidippos and Skythes painted vases in both red- and black-figure styles (Bilingual Pottery), primarily eye cups. The interior was usually in the black-figure style, the exterior in the red-figure style. There are several cases of amphoras whose front and back sides are decorated in the two different styles. The most famous are works by the Andokides Painter, whose black-figure scenes are attributed to the Lysippides Painter. Scholars are divided on the issue of whether these painters are the same person. Only a few painters, for example the Nikoxenos Painter and the Athena Painter, produced large quantities of vases using both techniques. Although bilingual pottery was quite popular for a short time, the style went out of fashion already toward the end of the century.[54] At the beginning of the 5th century BC until 480 BC at the latest, all painters of repute were using the red-figure style. But black-figure vases continued to be produced for some 50 additional years, with their quality progressively decreasing. The last painters producing acceptable quality images on large vases were the Eucharides Painter and the Kleophrades Painter. Only workshops which produced smaller shapes like olpes, oenoches, skyphos, small neck amphoras and particular lekythos increasingly used the old style. The Phanyllis Painter used the Six technique, among other methods, and both the Edinburgh Painter and the Gela Painter decorated the first cylindrical lekythos. The former primarily produced casual, clear and simple scenes using a black-figure style on a white ground. The white ground of the vases was quite thick and no longer painted directly on the clay foundation, a technique which became the standard for all white-ground vases. The Sappho Painter specialized in funerary lekythos. The workshop of the Haimon Painter was especially productive; over 600 of their vases have survived. The Athena Painter (who is perhaps identical with the red-figure Bowdoin Painter) and the Perseus Painter continued to decorate large, standard lekythos. The scenes of the Athena Painter still radiate some of the dignity inherent in the work of the Leagros Group. The Marathon Painter is primarily known for the funerary lekythos found in the tumulus for the Athenians who died in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. The last significant lekythos painter, the Beldam Painter, worked from around 470 BC until 450 BC. Except for the Panathenaic prize amphoras, the black-figure style came to a close in Attica at this time.[55]  Main article: Panathenaic amphora Among black-figure Attic vases, the Panathenaic prize amphoras play a special role. After 566 BCwhen the Panathenaic celebrations were introduced or reorganizedthey were the prize for the winners of sport competitions and were filled with olive oil, one of the city\'s main export goods. On the front they routinely bore the image of the goddess Athena standing between two pillars on which roosters perched; on the back there was a sports scene. The shape was always the same and was only modified slightly over the long period of its production. The belly amphora was, as its name suggests, originally especially bulbous, with a short neck and a long, narrow foot. Around 530 BC the necks become shorter and the body somewhat narrower. Around 400 BC the vase shoulders were considerably reduced in width and the curve of the vase body looked constricted. After 366 BC the vases were again more elegant and become even narrower. These vases were primarily produced in the leading workshops of the Kerameikos district. It seems to have been an honor or particularly lucrative to be awarded a commission for producing the vases. This also explains the existence of many prize amphoras by excellent vase painters. In addition to superior black-figure painters like the Euphiletos Painter, Exekias, Hypereides and the Leagros Group, many red-figure master craftsmen are known as creators of prize amphoras. These include the Eucharides Painter, the Kleophrades Painter, the Berlin Painter, the Achilleus Painter and Sophilos, who was the only one to have signed one of the surviving vases. The first known vase was produced by the Burgon Group and is known as the Burgon vase. Since the name of the ruling official (Archon) occasionally appears on the vase after the 4th century BC, some of the vases can be precisely dated. Since the Panathenaia were religious festivals, the style and the type of decoration changed neither during the red-figure period nor after figured vases were no longer really traded in Athens. The prize amphoras were produced into the 2nd century BC, and about 1,000 of them have survived. Since for some dates the number of amphorae awarded to a winner is known, it is possible to deduce that about one percent of the total production of Athenian vases has survived. Other projections lead to the conclusion that in all about seven million vases with painted figures were produced in Athens.[56] In addition to the prize amphoras, imitative forms known as Pseudo-Panathenaic prize amphoras were also manufactured.[57] (See also Laconian vase painting) Starting already in the 7th century BC painted pottery was being produced in Sparta for local consumption as well as for export. The first quality pieces were produced around 580 BC. The zenith in black-figure pottery was reached between about 575 and 525 BC. Besides Sparta, the main discovery sites are the islands of Rhodes and Samos, as well as Taranto, Etruscan necropolises, and Cyrene, which was at first considered to be the original source of the pottery. The quality of the vessels is very high. The clay was well slurried and was given a cream-colored coating. Amphoras, hydriai, column kraters (called krater lakonikos in antiquity), volute kraters, Chalcidic kraters, lebes, aryballoi and the Spartan drinking cup, the lakaina, were painted. But the index form and most frequent find is the cup. In Lakonia the deep bowl was usually put on a high foot; cups on low feet are rare. The exterior is typically decorated with ornaments, usually festoons of pomegranates, and the interior scene is quite large and contains figures. In Laconia earlier than in the rest of Greece the tondo became the main framework for cup scenes. The main image was likewise divided into two segments at an early date, a main scene and a smaller, lower one. Frequently the vessel was only coated with a glossy slip or decorated with just a few ornaments. Inscriptions are uncommon but can appear as name annotations. Signatures are unknown for potters as well as painters. It is probable that the Laconian craftsmen were perioeci pottery painters. Characteristic features of the pottery often match the fashion of known painters. It is also possible that they were migrant potters from eastern Greece, which would explain the strong eastern Greek influence especially on the Boreads Painter. In the meantime at least eight vase painters can be distinguished. Five painters, the Arkesilas Painter (565555), the Boreads Painter (575565), the Hunt Painter, the Naucratis Painter (575550) and the Rider Painter (550530) are considered to be the more important representatives of the style, while other painters are regarded as craftsmen of lesser ability. The images are usually angular and stiff, and contain animal friezes, scenes of daily life, especially symposia, and many mythological subjects. Of the latter, Poseidon and Zeus are depicted especially frequently, but also Heracles and his twelve labors as well as the Theban and Trojan legend cycles. Especially on the early vases, a gorgon grimace is placed in a cup tondo. A depiction of the nymph Cyrene and a tondo with a rider with a scrolling tendril growing from his head (name vase of the Rider Painter) are exceptional.[58] Also important is a cup with an image of Arcesilaus II. The Arcesilas cup supplied the pragmatic name for the Arcesilas Painter.[59] It is one of the rare depictions on Greek pottery of current events or people. The subjects suggest Attic influence. A reddish purple was the main opaque color. At present over 360 Laconian vases are known, with almost a third of them, 116 pieces, being attributed to the Naucratis Painter. The decline around 550 BC of Corinthian black-figure vase painting, which had an important influence on Laconian painting, led to a massive reduction in the Laconian production of black-figure vases, which came to an end around 500 BC. The pottery was very widely distributed, from Marseille to Ionian Greece. On Samos, Laconian pottery is more common than Corinthian pottery because of the close political alliance with Sparta.[60] (See also Boeotian vase painting) Schwarz-figure vases were produced in Boeotia from the 6th to the 4th century BC. As late as the early 6th century BC many Boeotian painters were using the orientalizing outline technique. Afterward they oriented themselves closely on Attic production. Distinctions and attributions to one of the two regions are sometimes difficult and the vases can also be confused with Corinthian pottery. Low-quality Attic and Corinthian vases are often declared to be Boeotian works. Frequently, good Boeotian vases are considered to be Attic and poor Attic vases are falsely considered to be Boeotian. There was probably an exchange of craftsmen with Attica. In at least one case it is certain that an Attic potter emigrated to Boeotia (the Horse-Bird Painter, and possibly also the Tokra Painter, and among the potters certainly Teisias the Athenian). The most important subjects are animal friezes, symposia and komos scenes. Mythological scenes are rare, and when present usually show Heracles or Theseus. From the late 6th century through the 5th century a silhouette-like style predominated. Especially kantharos, lekanis, cups, plates and pitchers were painted. As was the case in Athens, there are kalos inscriptions. Boeotian potters especially liked to produce molded vases, as well as kantharos with sculptured additions and tripod pyxides. The shapes of lekanis, cups and neck amphoras were also taken over from Athens. The painting style is often humorous, and there is a preference for komos scenes and satyrs.[61] Between 425 and 350 BC Kabeiric vases were the main black-figure style in Boeotia. In most cases this was a hybrid form between a kantharos and a skyphos with a deep bowl and vertical ring handles, but there were also lebes, cups and pyxides. They are named after the primary place where they were found, the Sanctuary of the Kabeiroi near Thebes. The scenes, usually painted on only one side of the vase, depict the local cult. The vases caricature mythological events in a humorous, exaggerated form. Sometimes komos scenes are shown, which presumably related directly to the cult.[62] (See also Euboean vase painting) Black-figure vase painting in Euboea was also influenced by Corinth and especially by Attica. It is not always easy to distinguish these works from Attic vases. Scholars assume that most of the pottery was produced in Eretria. Primarily amphoras, lekythos, hydria and plates were painted. Large-format amphoras were usually decorated with mythological scenes, such as the adventures of Herakles or the Judgment of Paris. The large amphoras, derived from 7th century shapes, have tapering lips and usually scenes relating to weddings. They are apparently funerary vases produced for children who died before they could marry. Restrained employment of incising and regular use of opaque white for the floral ornaments were typical features of black-figure pottery from Eretria. In addition to scenes reflecting Attic models, there were also wilder scenes like the rape of a deer by a satyr or Heracles with centaurs and demons. The vases of the Dolphin Class were previously regarded as being Attic, but are now considered to be Euboic. However, their clay does not match any known Eretrian sources. Perhaps the pieces were produced in Chalcis.[63] The origin of some black-figure regional styles is disputed. For example, Chalcidian pottery painting was once associated with Euboea; in the meantime production in Italy is considered to be more likely. (See also East Greek vase painting) In hardly any other region of Greece are the borders between the orientalizing and black-figure styles as uncertain as in the case of vases from eastern Greece. Until about 600 BC only outline drawings and empty spaces were employed. Then during the late phase of the orientalizing style incised drawings began to appear, the new technique coming from northern Ionia. The animal frieze style which had previously predominated was certainly decorative, but offered few opportunities for further technical and artistic development. Regional styles arose, especially in Ionia. Toward the end of the Wild Goat style, northern Ionian artists imitatedrather poorlyCorinthian models. But already in the 7th century high quality vases were being produced in Ionia. Since approximately 600 BC the black-figure style was used either entirely or in part to decorate vases. In addition to regional styles which developed in Klazomenai, Ephesus, Milet, Chios and Samos there were especially in northern Ionia styles which cannot be precisely localized. Oil flasks which adhered to the Lydian model (lydions) were common, but most of them were decorated only with stripes. There are also original scenes, for example a Scythian with a Bactrian camel, or a satyr and a ram. For some styles attribution is controversial. Thus the Northampton Group shows strong Ionian influence but production was probably in Italy, perhaps by immigrants from Ionia.[64] In Klazomenai primarily amphoras and hydria were painted in the middle of the 6th century BC (c. 550 to 350 BC), as well as deep bowls with flat, angular-looking figures. The vessels are not very elegant in workmanship. Dancing women and animals were frequently depicted. Leading workshops were those of the Tbingen Painter, the Petrie Painter, and the Urla Group. Most of the vases were found in Naukratis and in Tell Defenneh, which was abandoned in 525 BC. Their origin was initially uncertain, but Robert Zahn identified the source by comparison with images on Klazomenian sarcophagi. The pottery was often decorated with sculptured womens masks. Mythological scenes were rare; fishscale ornaments, rows of white dots, and stiff-looking dancing women were popular. The depection of a herold standing in front of a king and a queen is unique. In general, men were characterized by large, spade-shaped beards. Starting already in 600 BC and continuing to about 520 BC rosette cups, successor to the eastern Greece bird cups, were produced, probably in Klazomenai.[65] Samian pottery first appeared around 560/550 BC with forms adopted from Attica. These are Little Masters cups and kantharos with facial forms. The painting is precise and decorative. Samos along with Milet and Rhodes was one of the main centers for the production of vases in the Wild Goat style.[66] Rhodian vase painting is primarily known from Rhodian plates. These were produced using a polychrome technique with many of the details being incised as in black-figure painting. From about 560 to 530 BC situlas were common, inspired by Egyptian models. These show both Greek subjects, such as Typhon, as well as ancient Egyptian themes like Egyptian hieroglyphics and Egyptian sport disciplines.[67] "Caeretan hydria" is the name used for an especially colorful style of black-figure vase painting. The origin of these vases is disputed in the literature. Based on an assessment of the painting the vases were long considered to be Etruscan or Corinthian, but in recent years the view predominates that the producers were two pottery painters who emigrated from eastern Greece to Caere (modern Cerveteri) in Etruria. Inscriptions in Ionic Greek support the emigration theory. The workshop existed for only one generation. Today about 40 vases produced by the two master craftsmen in this style are known. All are hydriai except for one alabastron. None were found outside of Etruria; most came from Caere, which is the reason for their name. The vases are dated to approximately 530 to 510/500 BC. The Caeretan hydria are followed stylistically by neck amphoras decorated with stripes. These technically rather inferior hydriai are 4045cm. high. The bodies of these vases have high and very prominent necks, broad shoulders, and low ring feet in the form of upside-down chalices. Many of the hydriai are misshapen or show faulty firing. The painted images are in four zones: a shoulder zone, a belly zone with figures and one with ornaments, and a lower section. All but the belly zone with figures are decorated with ornaments. There is only one case of both belly friezes having figures. Their multiple colors distinguish them from all other black-figure styles. The style recalls Ionian vase painting and multicolored painted wooden tablets found in Egypt. Men are shown with red, black or white skin. Women are almost always portrayed with an opaque white color. The contours as well as the details are incised, as is typical for the black-figure style. Surfaces of black glossy slip are often covered with an additional colored slip, so that the black slip which becomes visible where there is scoring supplies the various shapes with internal details. On the front side the images are always full of action, on the back heraldic designs are common. Ornaments are an important component of the hydrias; they are not subsidiary to other motifs. Stencils were used to paint the ornaments; they are not incised. The Busiris Painter and the Eagle Painter are named as painters. The latter is considered the leading representative of this style. They were particularly interested in mythological topics which usually revealed an eastern influence. On the name vase by the Busiris painter, Heracles is trampling on the mythical Egyptian pharao Busiris. Heracles is frequently depicted on other vases as well, and scenes of daily life also exist. There are also uncommon scenes, such as Cetus accompanied by a white seal.[68] The Pontic vases are also closely related stylistically to Ionian pottery painting. Also in this case it is assumed that they were produced in Etruscan workshops by craftsmen who emigrated from Ionia. The vases got their misleading name from the depiction on a vase of archers thought to be Scythians, who lived at the Black Sea (Pontus). Most of the vases were found in graves in Vulci, a significant number also in Cerveteri. The index form was a neck amphora with a particularly slender shape, closely resembling Tyrrhenian amphoras. Other shapes were oenochoes with spiral handles, dinos, kyathos, plates, beakers with high bases, and, less often, kantharos and other forms. The adornment of Pontic vases is always similar. In general there is an ornamental decoration on the neck, then figures on the shoulder, followed by another band of ornaments, an animal frieze, and finally a ring of rays. Foot, neck and handles are black. The importance of ornaments is noticeable, although they are often rather carelessly formed; some vases are decorated only with ornaments. The clay of these vases is yellowish-red; the slip covering the vases is black or brownish-red, of high quality, and with a metallic sheen. Red and white opaque colors are generously used for figures and ornaments. Animals are usually decorated with a white stripe on their bellies. Scholars have identified six workshops to date. The earliest and best is considered to be that of the Paris Painter. He shows mythological figures, included a beardless Heracles, as was customary in eastern Greece. Occasionally there are scenes which are not a part of Greek mythology, such as Heracles fighting Juno Sospita ("the Savior") by the Paris Painter, or a wolf demon by the Tityos Painter. There are also scenes of daily life, komos scenes, and riders. The vases are dated to a time between 550 and 500 BC, and about 200 are known.[69] Locally produced Etruscan vases probably date from the 7th century BC. At first, they resemble black-figure models from Corinth and eastern Greece. It is assumed that in the early phase primarily Greek immigrants were the producers. The first important style was Pontic pottery painting. Afterward, in the period between 530 and 500 BC, the Micali Painter and his workshop followed. At this time Etruscan artists tended to follow Attic models and produced primarily amphoras, hydriai and jugs. They usually had komos and symposia scenes and animal friezes. Mythological scenes are less common, but they are very carefully produced. The black-figure style ended around 480 BC. Toward the end a mannerist style developed, and sometimes a rather careless silhouette technique.[70] Chalcidian vase painting was named from the mythological inscriptions which sometimes appeared in Chalcidian script. For this reason the origin of the pottery was first suspected to be Euboea. Currently it is assumed that the pottery was produced in Rhegion, perhaps also in Caere, but the issue has not yet been finally decided.[71] Chalcidian vase painting was influenced by Attic, Corinthian and especially Ionian painting. The vases were found primarily in Italian locations like Caeri, Vulci and Rhegion, but also at other locations of the western Mediterranean. The production of Chalcidian vases began suddenly around 560 BC. To date, no precursors have been identified. After 50 years, around 510 BC, it was already over. About 600 vases have survived, and 15 painters or painter groups have been so far identified. These vases are characterized by high quality pottery work. The glossy slip which covers them is usually pitch-black after firing. The clay has an orange color. Red and white opaque colores were generously used in the painting, as was scoring to produce interior details. The index form is the neck amphora, accounting for a quarter of all known vases, but there are also eye cups, oenochoes and hydria; other vessel types being less common. Lekanis and cups in the Etruscan style are exceptions. The vases are economical and stringent in construction. The "Chalcidian cup foot" is a typical characteristic. It is sometimes copied in black-figure Attic vases, less often in red-figured vases. The most important of the known artists of the older generation is the Inscription Painter, of the younger representatives the Phineus Painter. The former is presumably the originator of the style; some 170 of the surviving vases are attributed to the very productive workshop of the latter. He is probably also the last representative of this style. The images are usually more decorative than narrative. Riders, animal friezes, heraldic pictures or groups of people are shown. A large lotus-palmette cross is frequently part of the picture. Mythological scenes are seldom, but when they occur they are in general of exceptionally high quality. Pseudo-Chalcidian vase painting is the successor to Chalcidian painting. It is close to Chalcidian but also has strong links to Attic and Corinthian vase painting. Thus the artists used the Ionian rather than the Chalcidian alphabet for inscriptions. The structure of the clay is also different. There are about 70 known vases of this type, which were first classified by Andreas Rumpf. It is possible that the artisans were successors to the Chalcidian vase painters and potters who emigrated to Etruria.[72] Pseudo-Chalcidian vase painting is classified into two groups. The elder of the two is the Polyphemus Group, which produced most of the surviving vessels, primarily neck amphoras and oinochoes. Groups of animals are usually shown, less seldom mythological scenes. The vessels were found in Etruria, on Sicily, in Marsellle and Vix. The younger and less productive Memnon Group, to which 12 vases are currently attributed, had a much smaller geographical distribution, being limited to Etruria and Sicily. Except for one oinochoe they produced only neck amphoras, which were usually decorated with animals and riders.[73] The vases of the Northhampton Group were all small neck amphoras with the exception of a single belly amphora. They are stylistically very similar to northern Ionian vase painting, but were probably produced in Italy rather than in Ionia, perhaps in Etruria around 540 BC. The vases of this group are of very high quality. They show rich ornamental decorations and scenes that have captured the interest of scholars, such as a prince with horses and someone riding on a crane. They are similar to the work of the Group of Campana Dinoi and to the so-called Northampton Amphora whose clay is similar to that of Caeretan hydriai. The Northampton Group was named after this amphora. The round Campana hydriai recall Boeotian and Euboean models.[74] Alabastrons with cylindrical bodies from Andros are rare, as are lekanis from Thasos. These are reminiscent of Boeotian products except that they have two animal friezes instead of the single frieze common for Boeotia. Thasian plates rather followed Attic models and with their figured scenes are more ambitious than on the lekanis. Imitations of vases from Chios in the black-figure style are known. Local black-figure pottery from Halai is also rare. After the Athenians occupied Elaious on the Dardanelles, local black-figure pottery production began there as well. The modest products included simple lekanis with outline images. A small number of vases in black-figure style were produced in Celtic France. They too were almost certainly inspired by Greek vases.[75]  For a description of the research and reception prior to the 19th century refer to the kindrid article Red-figure pottery as there are no significant differences in the research on both styles. Scholarly research on these vases started especially in the 19th century. Since this time the suspicion has intensified that these vases have a Greek rather than an Etruscan origin. Especially a Panathenaic prize amphora found by Edward Dodwell in 1819 in Athens provided evidence. The first to present a proof was Gustav Kramer in his work Styl und Herkunft der bemalten griechischen Tongefe (1837). However it took several years for this insight to be generally accepted. Eduard Gerhard published an article entitled Rapporto Volcente in the Annali dellInstituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica in which he systematically investigated the vases; he was the first scholar to do so. Toward this end in 1830 he studied vases found in Tarquinia, comparing them, for example, with vases found in Attica and Aegina. During this work he identified 31 painter and potter signatures. Previously, only the potter Taleides was known.[76] The next step in research was scientific cataloging of the major vase collections in museums. In 1854 Otto Jahn published the vases in the Munich State Collection of Antiquities. Previously, catalogs of the Vatican museums (1842) and the British Museum (1851) had been published. The description of the vase collection in the Berlin Collection of Classical Antiquities, put together in 1885 by Adolf Furtwngler, was especially influential. Furtwngler was the first to classify the vessels by region of artistic origin, technology, style, shape, and painting stye, which had a lasting effect on subsequent research. In 1893 Paul Hartwig attempted in his book Meisterschalen to identify various painters based on kalos inscriptions, signatures and style analyses. Edmond Pottier, curator at the Louvre, initiated in 1919 the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum. All major collections worldwide are published in this series, which as of 2009 amounted to over 300 volumes.[77] Scientific research on Attic vase painting owes a great deal to John D. Beazley. He began studying these vases in about 1910, making use of the method developed by the art historian Giovanni Morelli for studying paintings, which had been refined by Bernard Berenson. He assumed that each painter created original works which could always be unmistakably attributed. He made use of particular details such as faces, fingers, arms, legs, knees, and folds of clothing. Beazley studied 65,000 vases and fragments, of which 20,000 were black-figure. In the course of his studies, which lasted almost six decades, he could attribute 17,000 of them by name or by using a system of pragmatic names, and classified them into groups of painters or workshops, relationships and stylistic affinity. He identified over 1,500 potters and painters. No other archaeologist had such a decisive influence on the research of an archaeological field as did Beazley, whose analyses remain valid to a large extent up to the present time. After Beazley, scholars like John Boardman, Erika Simon and Dietrich von Bothmer investigated black-figure Attic vases.[78] Basic research on Corinthian pottery was accomplished by Humfry Payne, who in the 1930s made a first stylistic classification which is, in essence, being used up to the present time. He classified the vases according to shape, type of decoration and image subjects, and only afterward did he make distinctions as to painters and workshops. He followed Beazleys method except for attributing less importance to allocating painters and groups since a chronological framework was more important for him. Jack L. Benson took on this allocation task in 1953 and distinguished 109 painters and groups. Last of all, Darrell A. Amyx summarized the research up to that point in his 1988 book Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. It is however a matter of scholarly dispute whether it is at all possible in the case of Corinthian pottery to attribute specific painters.[79] Laconian pottery was known since the 19th century from a significant number of vases from Etruscan graves. At first they were erroneously attributed, being considered for a long time to be a product of Cyrene, where some of the earliest pieces were also found. Thanks to British excavations carried out in Spartas Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia, their true origin was quickly identified. In 1934, Arthur Lane put together all the known material and was the first archaeologist to identify different artists. In 1956 the new discoveries were studied by Brian B. Shefton. He reduced the number of distinct painters by half. In 1958 and 1959 other new material from Taranto was published. A significant number of other vases were also found on Samos. Conrad Michael Stibbe studied anew all 360 vases known to him and published his findings in 1972. He identified five major and three minor painters.[80] In addition to research on Attic, Corinthian and Laconian vase painting, archaeologists are frequently especially interested in minor Italian styles. The Caeretan hydriai were first identified and named by Carl Humann and Otto Puchstein. Andreas Rumpf, Adolf Kirchhoff and other archaeologists erroneously suspected the origin of Chalkidischen Pottery to be Euboea. Georg Ferdinand Dmmler is responsible for the false naming of the Pontic vases, which he assumed to come from the Black Sea area because of the depiction of a Scythian on one of the vases.[81] In the meantime, research on all styles is carried out less by individuals than by a large international group of scientists.

aS'Moses Lake Air Force Base Larson Air Force Base is a former United States Air Force base located five miles (8km) northwest of the central business district (CBD) of Moses Lake, in Grant County, Washington. After its closure in 1966, the airport facility became Grant County International Airport. Larson Air Force Base was named in honor of Major Donald A. Larson, USAAF, in May 1950.[1][2] Born and raised in Yakima, Washington, Larson was a fighter pilot and ace[3] who flew 57 combat missions in Europe during World War II. He was killed in action while assigned to the VIII Fighter Command 505th Fighter Squadron. Larson\'s P-51D Mustang (AAF Ser. No. 44-13881, nose-name "Mary, Queen of Scotts") was shot down and crashed on 4 August 1944 near Uelzen, Germany. He was buried in the Ardennes American Cemetery at Neuville-en-Condroz, nine miles (14km) west of Lige, Belgium. Larson\'s medals and decorations include the Silver Star, Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Cluster, Air Medal with three clusters, Purple Heart, American Defense Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with two bronze stars, American Area Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal (posthumously). An identical twin born in 1915, Larson enlisted as a flying cadet at McChord Field near Tacoma in April 1941, and completed advanced flight training in California and went overseas in January 1944.[4][5] Originally named Moses Lake Army Air Base, the airfield was activated on 24 November 1942 as a temporary World War II training center. Moses Lake AAB was a sub-base of Spokane Air Technical Service Command, headquartered at Spokane Army Airfield.[6] The first operational training unit (OTU) at the base was the 482d Fighter Squadron, which conducted twin-engine fighter training for P-38 Lightning fighters. On 5 April 1943, the 396th Bombardment Group became a second OTU at the base, providing first phase heavy bomber training for the B-17 Flying Fortress with its 592d, 593d, 594th and 595th Bombardment Squadrons.[7][8] In 1945, base activity was curtailed to standby and for three years, was used to test two famous bomber aircraft: the B-47 and the B-50. Even though Moses Lake AAB (later Moses Lake AFB) was on standby, it was still playing a critical role in the development of the USAF aircraft. In 1949, a B-47 took off from Larson, headed east and began a coast-to-coast speed race. Moses Lake AFB reopened as a permanent installation on 26 August 1948, being transferred from Air Material Command to the Air Defense Command (ADC). The initial ADC base operating unit was the 2755th Air Base Squadron. Under ADC, the base came under the Western Air Defense Force, headquartered at Hamilton AFB, California. The primary mission of Larson-based ADC aircraft was to protect the secret Hanford Atomic Works and the Grand Coulee Dam. The ADC first flying organization was the 325th Fighter-Interceptor Group, arriving at the base on 26 November 1948. The mission of the 325th FIG was to conduct ADC\'s All Weather Combat Crew Training School. It\'s operational component, the 317th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, initially flew P-61 Black Widows, almost immediately transitioning to the F-82 Twin Mustang. A second squadron, the 319th Fighter Interceptor Squadron arrived on 2 September 1949, being reassigned from McChord AFB. The 319th also flew the F-82 Twin Mustang.[9][10] The 325th FIG remained at Moses Lake until being reassigned to McChord AFB on 23 April 1950. Its component squadrons at Moses Lake, the 317th also moved to McChord on 23 April. The 319th remained until 9 February 1952 when it was reassigned to Suwon AB, South Korea flying F-94 Starfires.[9] The next ADC unit was the 81st Fighter-Interceptor Wing which arrived on From 10 November 1949. The 81st FIW flew F-51D/H Mustangs, F-80C Shooting Stars and F-86A Sabres from the base. The 81st remained until 5 September 1951 when it was reassigned to NATO and deployed to RAF Shepherds Grove, England.[11][12][13] During the Korean War, the 116th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron (Washington Air National Guard) was called to active duty and activated at Moses Lake. The 116th FIS was deployed as part of 81st TFW to RAF Shepherds Grove. In September 1948 the Air Force authorized the Air Defense Command to put thirteen temporary radar stations in operation. These stations were in operation by mid-1949. Additional stations were added across the nation in 1949 and 1950. This temporary system was given the name "Lashup" to distinguish it from the interim system for which the Air Force was seeking appropriations. A total of forty-four stations were established under this program. These sites were designated L. Moses Lake AFB was selected as L-29 in July 1950, equipped with AN/CPS-5, AN/CPS-1, and AN/CPS-4 radars, operated by the 637th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron until their transfer to Saddle Mountain AFS, Washington (LP-40) in January 1952. In 1957, Air Defense Command selected Larson AFB as the location of a Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-15). The SAGE system was a network linking Air Force (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack. This automated control system was used by NORAD for tracking and intercepting enemy bomber aircraft. In the later versions the system could automatically direct aircraft to an interception by sending instructions directly to the aircraft\'s autopilot. Activated on 8 September 1958, DC-15 was commanded by the Spokane Air Defense Sector under the 25th Air Division. The Sector was disestablished on 1 September 1963 due the high costs of operation, the sector merged with the DC-12 Direction Center at McChord AFB under he Seattle Air Defense Sector. After its closure, the SAGE building remained in use by the Air Force for other offices, and after the closure of Larson AFB in 1966, it remained in government hands. In 2000, the building was sold and the company that now either owns or leases the building is "Titan," a company who provides secure off-sire storage of business records. On 21 April 1952, Larson AFB was assigned to the Tactical Air Command (TAC) under TAC\'s Eighteenth Air Force, which reassigned the 62nd Troop Carrier Wing from McChord AFB, Washington to the base. The Air Defense Command units then became tenants on the base. The 4721st Air Defense Group was activated at Larson in 1956 to centralize supervision and support of 322d FIS and 538th FIS. It was later inactivated as part of ADC closedown at Larson prior to it being assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC). For the next eight years, the 62nd was very active, routinely performing troop carrier, air transport, and humanitarian missions on a global scale flying C-124 Globemaster II aircraft. It participated in the airlift of French troops from France to Indochina in Operation Bali-Hai, AprilMay 1954. Provided a major portion of the airlift needed to construct the distant early warning (DEW) line in northern Alaska and Canada, 19551956, and thereafter periodically resupplied the DEW line stations. During the international geophysical year 19571958, and subsequently through 1960, supported scientific stations in the Arctic Ocean by landing and airdropping supplies on the drifting ice. From 195559, the Air Materiel Command Flight Test Center at Larson tested the B-52 bomber. Boeing built a huge hangar, 1,068 feet (326m) long, 372 feet (113m) wide, with clear spans of 217 feet (66m) and able to hold eight B-52s under one roof. On 26 January 1955, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) 71st Strategic Reconnaissance Wing was activated to perform strategic reconnaissance with B-36 and RB-36 Peacekeeper bomber. The wing was also assigned to test a technique for launching small RBF-84 Thunderjet aircraft from specially-configued GRB-36 Peacekeeper bombers, to extend the range of photographic reconnaissance and fighter escort. Tests ended in 1956, but the wing continued bombardment training and strategic reconnaissance until inactivated in 1957. Larson AFB became a Military Air Transport Service (MATS) Continental Division base on 1 July 1957. The 62d TCW was reassigned as part of the transfer of C-124 wings from TAC to MATS. Strategic Air Command assumed command of Larson AFB in 1960 and established the Fifteenth Air Force\'s 4170th Strategic Wing (4170th SW). The MATS 62d TCW was reassigned back to McChord AFB on 13 June 1960 where it continues to operate today as the 62d Airlift Wing with C-17 Globemaster III aircraft. The mission of SAC at Larson AFB was to be a B-52 Stratofortress strategic bombardment wing base. Colonel Clyde W. Owen, USAF, was assigned by SAC as the first commander of the 4170 SW. Crews and aircraft of the 327th Bombardment Squadron arrived from Fairchild AFB, Washington on 13 July 1960 and the first B-52D to arrive was christened "Larson\'s Lucky Lady". The 43d Air Refueling Squadron and its KC-135 Stratotankers moved from Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona to Larson AFB on 15 November 1960, thus completing one of the most advanced air weapon systems in SAC. The mission of the 43rd ARS was to insure the global strike capability of SAC bombers by providing high speed aerial refueling support with modern jet tanker aircraft. The 568th Strategic Missile Squadron was later activated in 1961 as part of the 4170th SW with three missile complexes, each housing three HGM-25A Titan I missiles. The complexes were located at Royal City, Warden, and Odessa. On 1 February 1963, the 4170th Strategic Wing was re-designated the 462d Strategic Aerospace Wing in honor of the 462d Bombardment Group of World War II. The 327th Bomb Squadron was redesignated the 768th Bomb Squadron after one of the 462d units. The redesignated wing continued conducting strategic bombardment, air refueling and associated SAC Nuclear Alert Force operations. In November 1964, it was announced that Larson AFB would be closed due to DoD budget reductions which mandated a reduction in B-52 bases and the inactivation of the Titan I ICBM. The ICBM sites were deactivated officially on 25 March 1965. The 462d Strategic Aerospace Wing was inactivated in April 1966 and the base was closed on 30 June 1966. With the closure of the base, Colonel Owen retired from the Air Force and became the first director of the Port of Moses Lake, overseeing the transfer of the property from the U.S. Government to Grant County International Airport.[14][15][16] Following the Air Force\'s departure in 1966, the airfield has continued to support operations from McChord\'s 62d Airlift Wing over the years, as the wing\'s C-141, C-130, and currently C-17 aircraft have practiced approaches and both normal landings and tactical assault landings on a regular basis. The 92nd Air Refueling Wing at Fairchild AFB in Spokane temporarily moved its KC-135 R/T fleet and operations to Moses Lake in 2011 while Fairchild\'s runway underwent reconstruction and other infrastructure improvements, to include an upgrade to the base\'s aviation fuel distribution system.[17][18] For over four decades, Japan Air Lines trained its 747 crews at the facility, until 2009.[14][16][19][20][21] Known ADC units and squadrons assigned to Larson were:[9][11] The 568th Strategic Missile Squadron Operated three three HGM-25A Titan I ICBM sites: (1 Apr 1961  25 Mar 1965) The Titan I ICBM program at Larson was initiated in 1959 when the Walla Walla District of the Army Corps of Engineers set up an area office in October. The contractor broke ground on 1 December 1959 and the sites were turned over to SAC in early April 1961. In May 1964 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara directed that the phase-out of the Atlas and Titan I missiles be accelerated, and in January 1965 the missiles of the 568th were taken off operational alert. The squadron was deactivated 2 months later. Today, site "A" appears to be largely intact, the owner has the facility for sale. Photos of the interior show it to be in good condition. Site "B" appears to be largely cleared, the silo launch doors of two pads appear to be open, and is also apparently also for sale. Site "C" appears to be a scrap site, filled with clutter; its underground facilities apparently are flooded by groundwater.

aS"Colombo Town Guard was regiment attached to the Ceylon Defence Force which was the predecessor to the Sri Lanka Army prior to 1949 when the Ceylon Army was formed. It was a volunteer (reserve) regiment was based in Colombo. The Town Guard regiment was mobilized only on two occasions, these were during World War I and World War II. Primarily operating as a defensive force for Ceylon's then capital Colombo the regiment was made up of residents of Colombo with both British and Ceylonese Officers. Members of the regiment included many personalities who became important figures in Sri Lankan history. When formed in both 1914 and 1939 the primary task of the regiment was the defence of Colombo from enemy invasion and had the secondary task of protecting the British control over the colony. In 1915 during the Sinhalese-Moor Riots the Town Guard was called to restore public order with authorization to fire. As a result many people including rioters were killed under the Martial Law proclamations lasting 100 days. This was the artillery element form to support the Colombo town guard formed at the outset of World War I. This absorbed in to the Ceylon Garrison Artillery when it was formed in 1918. In 2006 due to the Sri Lankan Civil War the Sri Lankan Government announced a formation of a Home Guard unit made up of residents of Colombo for deployments within the city. This was not a reforming of the town guard as the new unit came under the authority of the Department of Civil Defence (Sri Lanka) unlike the town guard that came under the command of the army. This was the first time a home guard unit was formed within Colombo."

aS'Baayork Lee (born December 5, 1946) is an Asian-American actress, singer, dancer, choreographer, theatre director, and author. Lee was born in New York City\'s Chinatown to an Indian mother and Chinese father. She started dancing at an early age, and she made her Broadway debut at the age of five as Princess Ying Yawolak in the original production of The King and I in 1951. Yul Brynner, the original king, was like a second father to her. After she outgrew the show, she first collected unemployment at age eight. With further dance study in ballet, modern, and afro-Cuban, she appeared in George Balanchine\'s original production of The Nutcracker, where she met another idol, ballerina Maria Tallchief, whom she hoped to emulate.[1] While attending the High School for Performing Arts, she met fellow student Michael Bennett, and appeared in Flower Drum Song, in which she was taught to walk in high heels. When reaching her full height of four foot, ten inches (147cm), her dreams of becoming a ballerina were dashed because she was deemed too short. Next, when offered a scholarship to Juilliard, Lee instead chose to further her career and Broadway appearances included Mr. President, Golden Boy, and Here\'s Love. Her next three shows were all choreographed by her old friend, Michael Bennett: A Joyful Noise, Henry, Sweet Henry, and Promises, Promises (in which she performed the famous dance Turkey Lurkey Time with Donna McKechnie and Margo Sappington). Lee was dance captain for Promises, Promises, and recreated the choreography for subsequent touring productions, starting her future path as choreographer. In 1973, she travelled to Israel to film Norman Jewison\'s version of Jesus Christ Superstar. In 1973, she appeared in Bennett\'s Seesaw and was featured opposite Tommy Tune. Again assisting with the choreography, if Bob Avian was Bennett\'s right hand, Lee had become his left. In 1975, Lee was invited by Michael Bennett to participate in the workshops from which A Chorus Line was developed. The role of "Connie Wong" was in large part, based upon her own life. Her bubbly and vibrant energy[2] and "dynamo" personality were reflected in her brief solo, although Lee reports her mother disliked her daughter\'s singing. Lee laughingly blamed the notes. (Her "Four foot, ten" solo, long missing from the album, was finally heard on a re-release in the late 1990s). Along with the cast, she won the 1976 Theatre World Award for Ensemble Performance for the show. Over the years she has directed or choreographed more than thirty-five international productions of the musical, including the most recent Broadway revival in 2006. Fifteen years later, along with cast member Thommie Walsh and Robert Viagas, she documented the evolution of A Chorus Line in the book On the Line: the Creation of A Chorus Line, published in 1990. The 2008 feature documentary "Every Little Step" chronicles the casting process of A Chorus Line\'s 2006 revival, which was choreographed by Lee, and, in the course of the film, the saga of the original production is re-told as well, through the use of old film clips and revealing interviews from the original collaborators, including Lee. Lee had become one of Bennett\'s closest collaborators and helped develop the choreography in many of his shows. Starting in the 1970s, Lee stepped out on her own choreographing Where\'s Charley? in New Jersey. Since then, she has directed national and international tours of The King & I, Bombay Dreams, Rodgers and Hammerstein\'s Cinderella, Barnum, Porgy and Bess, Jesus Christ Superstar, and Carmen Jones. She was Associate Choreographer for Tommy Tune. She also has choreographed several productions for the Washington National Opera at the Kennedy Center. She also choreographed the ill-fated Marilyn: An American Fable when Kenny Ortega was fired during rehearsals. Other projects include becoming a talent scout for Tokyo Disneyland, opening a musical theater school in Seoul, South Korea, and producing. Lee was the recipient of the 2003 Lifetime Achievement Asian Woman Warrior Award from Columbia College Chicago.[3]'

aS'A currency transaction tax is a tax placed on the use of currency for various types of transactions. The tax is associated with the financial sector and is a type of financial transaction tax, as opposed to a consumption tax paid by consumers. Currency transaction taxes have been proposed as taxes on domestic currency usage as part of the automated payment transaction (APT) tax and on international currency transactions the Tobin tax and the Spahn tax. The automated payment transaction (APT) tax was first proposed in Buenos Aires at the International Institute of Public Finance Conference by Edgar L. Feige in 1989 and an extended version of the proposal appeared in Economic Policy in 2000.[1] The APT tax proposal is a generalization of the Keynes tax [2] and the Tobin tax.[3] The APT tax consists of a small flat tax levied on all transactions. The tax is automatically assessed and collected when transactions are settled through the electronic technology of the banking/payments system. In order to assure that all cash transactions are also taxed, the APT system proposes to exact a tax on currency as it enters and leaves the banking system. In order to be an effective means of discouraging currency usage for tax evasion, the APT tax imposes a tax rate on currency higher than the rate automatically charged on cheque transactions. Since cash can be used multiple times between the time it enters into circulation and the time it is returned to the banking system, the APT currency transaction tax is set at a multiple of the rate charged for all other transactions using non cash payment methods. A Tobin tax is a tax on all spot conversions of one currency into another. Named after the economist James Tobin, the tax is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. Tobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the Bretton Woods system effectively ended.[4] In 1995, Paul Bernd Spahn suggested an alternative involving "a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax, plus an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates as a piggyback. The latter would be dormant in times of normal financial activities, and be activated only in the case of speculative attacks. The mechanism allowing the identification of abnormal trading in world financial markets would make reference to a "crawling peg" with an appropriate exchange rate band. The exchange rate would move freely within this band without transactions being taxed. Only transactions effected at exchange rates outside the permissible range would become subject to tax. This would automatically induce stabilizing behavior on the part of market participants."[5] On June 15, 2004, the Commission of Finance and Budget in the Belgian Federal Parliament approved a bill implementing a Spahn tax. According to the legislation, Belgium will introduce the Spahn tax once all countries of the eurozone introduce a similar law.[6] In July 2005 former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schssel called for a European Union Tobin tax which he thought would base the communities\' financial structure on more stable and independent grounds. However, the proposal was rejected by the European Commission. On September 19, 2001, retired speculator George Soros put forward a proposal, special drawing rights or SDRs that the rich countries would pledge for the purpose of providing international assistance, without necessarily dismissing the Tobin tax idea. He stated, "I think there is a case for a Tobin tax... (but) it is not at all clear to me that a Tobin tax would reduce volatility in the currency markets. It is true that it may discourage currency speculation but it would also reduce the liquidity of the marketplace." [7] In 1994, Canadian economist Rodney Schmidt noted that "in two-thirds of all the outright forward and currency swap transactions, the money moved into another currency for fewer than seven days. In only 1 per cent did the money stay for as long as one year. While the volatile exchange rates caused by all this rapid movement posed problems for national economies, it was the bread and butter of those playing the currency markets. Without constant fluctuations in the currency markets, Schmidt noted, there was little opportunity for profit."[8] "This certainly seemed to suggest the interests of currency traders and the interests of ordinary citizens were operating at cross-purposes."[8] "Schmidt also noted another interesting aspect of the foreign- exchange market: The dominant players were the private banks, which had huge pools of capital and access to information about currency values. Since much of the market involved moving large sums of money (typically in the tens of millions of dollars) for very short periods of time (often less than a day), banks were perfectly positioned to participate. Among swap transactions, which represented a major chunk of the foreign exchange market, 86 per cent of the transactions were actually between banks."[8] A representative of a pro Tobin tax NGO argued as follows: "[The Tobin tax] is designed to reduce the power financial markets have to determine the economic policies of national governments. Traditionally, a countrys central bank buys and sells its own currency on international markets to keep its value relatively stable. The bank buys back its currency when a glut caused by an investor selloff threatens to reduce the currencys value. In the past, most central banks had enough cash in reserve to offset any selloff or attack. However, this is no longer the case. Speculators now have more cash than all the worlds central banks put together. Official global reserves are less than half the value of one day of global foreign-exchange turnover. Many countries are simply unable to protect their currencies from speculative attack."[9] "By cutting down on the overall volume of foreign-exchange transactions, a Tobin Tax would mean that central banks would not need as much [reserve money to defend their currency. The tax would allow governments the freedom to act in the best interests of their own economic development, rather than being forced to shape fiscal and monetary policies according to demands of fickle financial markets."[9] In early November 2007, a regional Tobin tax was adopted by the Bank of the South in Latin America, after an initiative of Presidents Hugo Chavez from Venezuela and Nstor Kirchner from Argentina.[10] See also the Supporters and Opposers of the Tobin tax'

aS'Raymond Brock (14 October 1936  1 January 2008) was for over forty years a leading English bridge player and then administrator. In 1987 he was a member of the British team that won the silver medal in both the European Bridge Championship and the Bermuda Bowl (the World Championship). This success came during his partnership with Tony Forrester, which lasted from 1982 to 1990. He achieved the rank of World Bridge Master through his performances. Brock was educated at Manchester University and became a physics teacher at a Manchester school. A subsequent job as a computer manager with Honeywell took him to Glasgow from 1968 to 1975. Whilst living there he played seven matches for Scotland; the team won the Camrose Trophy - for which England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland compete - three times during this period. Before and afterwards he played for England, with 26 appearances for the country in all. Additionally on four occasions he was non-playing captain of the England team, as well as serving as a selector. He won the Gold Cup, the premier British domestic competition, seven times. He was twice President of the British Bridge League and was non-playing captain of many Great Britain teams, including the bronze medal winning Women in the 1980 World Team Olympiad and the gold medal winning Juniors at the 1989 World Championships. He did much coaching of the best young players, and in 1994 was non-playing captain of the British Junior team that won the European Championships and went on to win the World title the following year. He wrote several books, in particular on defence, a part of the game at which he was especially expert. These include Planning the Defence (1996) and Expert Defence (1997). While with Honeywell at Brentford, Middlesex in the late seventies and early eighties, some of his early bridge writing included chapters on the Stayman convention. His vacations during this time were spent at Monte Carlo playing bridge with the likes of Omar Sharif. He died of cancer. His widow, Sally, is herself an international bridge player. Together they won the England Mixed Teams event on six occasions and the British Mixed Pairs twice.  '

aS'Hymenaeus[1] (fl. 5065, 1Timothy 1:20, 2Timothy 2:17) was an early Christian from Ephesus, an opponent of the apostle Paul, who associates him with Alexander and Philetus. In 1Timothy 1:20, Hymenaeus is included in the "some" who had put away faith and a good conscience and who had made shipwreck concerning faith.[2] The apostle adds that he had delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan, that they might learn not to blaspheme. Some have viewed this statement as similar to 1 Corinthians 5:5, where Paul commands the church to expel a member engaging in sexual immorality, in the hopes that his spirit would eventually be saved as a result of this discipline.[3] Hymenaeus and Philetus are included among persons whose profane and vain babblings will increase towards more ungodliness, and whose teaching "will spread as a cancer" (2Tim 2:17, NLT). The apostle declares that Hymenaeus and Philetus are examples of those just described, and he adds that those two persons "concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some." Then, for the guidance of Timothy, he goes on to say the seal upon the foundation of God is, "The LORD knows those who are his, and All who belong to the LORD must turn away from evil" (2Tim 2:19, NLT). The inference intended is, that though Hymenaeus and Philetus had professed their faith in Christ, they did not turn away from evil. There is no doubt in regard to the identity of this Hymenaeus with the person of the same name in 1 Tim. Accordingly, the facts mentioned in the two epistles must be placed in the following order: That though Hymenaeus had, The error, therefore, of Hymenaeus and his two companions would amount to this: They taught that "the resurrection is past already," circa 50AD65AD, and that there would be no future resurrection, but that all that resurrection means is that the soul awakes from sin. This teaching of Hymenaeus had been so far successful: it had "overthrown the faith of some" (2Tim 2:18). It Is impossible to define exactly the full nature of this heresy, but from what Paul says regarding it, Hymenaeus and Philetus may have believed in an early form of the Christian heresy of Gnosticism. This awakening from sin had taken place with themselves, so the Gnostics held, and therefore there could be no day in the future when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and shall come forth from the grave (John 5:28). This spiritualizing of the resurrection sprang from the idea of the necessarily evil nature of all material substance. This idea immediately led to the conclusion of the essentially evil nature of the human body, and that if man is to rise to his true nature, he must rid himself of the thraldom, not of sin, but of the body. This contempt for the body led to the denial of the resurrection in its literal sense; and all that Christ had taught on the subject was explained only, in an allegorical sense, of the resurrection of the soul from sin.[4] The way in which the apostle dealt with these teachers, Hymenaeus and his companions, was not merely in the renewed assertion of the truth which they denied, but also by passing sentence upon these teachers"whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme." In regard to the meaning of this sentence much difficulty of interpretation exists. Some understand it to mean simple excommunication from the church. Others take it to signify the infliction of some bodily suffering or disease. It seems that a person who was delivered unto Satan was cut off from all Christian privileges, he was "put away" from the body of Christian believers, and handed over to "the Saian," the Evil One in his most distinct personality (1Cor 5). Cf. the cases of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5), and of Elymas (Acts 13:11). The intention of the punishment was distinctly remedial. Both in the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander, and in that of the person dealt with in 1Cor 5, the intention was the attaining of an ultimate good. In 1 Cor it is "for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." Similarly, Hymenaeus and Alexander are delivered unto Satan, not for their final perdition, but that they may be taught, through this terrible discipline, not to blaspheme. '

aS"The author Jane Austen, as well as her works, have been represented in popular culture in a variety of forms. Jane Austen (16 December 1775  18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose social commentary and masterly use of both free indirect speech and irony eventually made her one of the most influential and honored novelists in English literature. In popular culture, Austen's novels and her personal life have been adapted into film, television, and theater, with different adaptations varying greatly in their faithfulness to the original. In 2007, Anne Hathaway starred as Austen in Becoming Jane. [1] Based on the biography Becoming Jane Austen by Jon Hunter Spence,[2] the film centered on Jane Austen's early life, her development as an author, and the posited romantic relationship with Thomas Langlois Lefroy (James McAvoy).[1] Miss Austen Regrets, a television movie starring Olivia Williams as Jane Austen, was released in the same year. Based on Austen's surviving letters, the semi-biographical television movie focused on the last few years of Jane Austen's life as she looked back on her life and loves and helped her favorite niece, Fanny Knight (Imogen Poots), find a husband. JANE, the musical debuted in June 2006 in the West Midlands, England. It is a West-End style musical theatre production based on the life of Jane Austen. The musical, directed by Geetika Lizardi, focuses on Austen as a modern heroine, a woman who chose art and integrity over the security of a loveless marriage. Jane Austen features as an amateur sleuth in Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen series of historical mystery novels. "

aS'L/R: Licensed by Royalty is a Japanese anime television series created by Itsur Kawasaki with the written screenplay by Kazuki Matsui for TNK. The show is set in an alternate world where the United Kingdom and Ireland do not exist with Ishtar and Ivory taking their places with the rest of the world. It centers on Cloud 7, an intelligence organization whose mandate is to protect the Ishtarian Royal Family and their property from criminals/terrorists/assassins. The two main characters of the show are Jack Hofner and Rowe Rickenbacker, who are known in the intelligence world and by criminals, terrorists and assassins as L/R. The series focuses mainly on the protection of Noelle Ardelade, a 14 year old girl from Ivory as she has links to the Ishtarian monarchy. The title name is changed from the original Japanese title, L/R: Licensed by Royal,[1] for North America and Europe. Jack Hofner and Rowe Rickenbacker, Cloud 7\'s top agents, are mandated to do anything in their power to protect the Ishtarian royal family as well as their reputation while also protecting their property from crime and terrorism. While a few of their cases involved the protection of royal artifacts and royal family affiliates, Jack and Rowe were tasked by Commander Camille Freed to secure Noelle Ardelade, a supposed native of Ivory Island from press publicity. As time continues to pass, the two agents continued to get involved in corruption, bombings and murder to solve a case that could rock Ishtar\'s national foundation. Jack and Rowe, working under Mister\'s orders, are placed in a black operation to expose top officials of DTI and Duke Regent Rand for their involvement in the assassination of Prince Sparda after he found out that there were illegal dealings in securing Ivorystone from Ivory. The two agents fake the assassination of Noelle in front of a live audience, which was also televised worldwide, to arrest the Duke and DTI Chairman Taylor for the prince\'s death. The series ends with Noelle continuing her life as a civilian after her supposed death. Rowe was stabbed in the back by Frost, who had been previously been the Information Division\'s director of the now disgraced DTI. The ending is left to interpretation as the last episode show the smashed picture frame of Jack and Rowe with Noelle, especially on whether Rowe had survived the stabbing while returning on an errand.[2] Cloud 7 is an intelligence agency mandated by the Ishtaran Royal Family to protect them and their property, under the control of the Royal Houseguard.[3] Because of this, they are allowed to operate locally and abroad if the cases they are working on concerns the royal family without any problems. The agency is run by Holden Pennylane, known as Mister. Among the personnel of Cloud 7 are Jack Hofner, Rowe Rickenbaker, Claire Pennylane and Dez. Their headquarters is located in downtown Ishtar. Cool, relaxed and sophisticated, Jack Hofner (, Jyaku Hefunaa?) is one of the agents working for Cloud 7 and one of the members of the L/R duo. A blonde-hared man, he wears a white suit with a yellow and blue dress shirt. One of the things he enjoys to do is to smoke. Near the end of the series, he and Rowe take down Taylor for being the mastermind of the death of Prince Sparda with help from mercenary sniper Gray Stratos. Prior to working with Rowe, his old partner was Claudia Eastman.[4] At the end of the series, Jack confronts Frost on a street near Cloud 7 HQ after seeing the fallen body of Rowe. The screen goes black after a gunshot rings off, which is suggested that Jack had fired his sidearm at Frost since it is shown that he survived the confrontation. His symbol is a Roadster token when he is summoned to Cloud 7 HQ.[5] Rowe Rickenbacker (, Rowo Riikenbackaa?) is also a secret agent working for Cloud 7 and the partner of Jack Hoffman, who speaks more of his mind than Jack. He has brown hair in a ponytail and wears a red shirt and a black trenchcoat. Like Jack, he smokes when he is not on an operation. He also enjoys cracking dirty jokes at Jack and Claire. Rowe gets involved in missions that needs disguises. To lure out the culprits responsible for assassinating Prince Sparda and driving Princess Ciel from the royal family, Rowe was ordered to "kill" Noelle in front of a live audience.[2][6] Near the end of the series, Rowe was stabbed in the back by a disgraced Frost after the ex-DTI Information Director secretly followed him.[2] It is unknown whether Rowe had surviving the attack. His symbol is a boot, which was never used in the gameboard to summon Rowe to Cloud 7 HQ.[6] Mister (, Misuta?) is the head of Cloud 7 and a retired secret agent[5] who was appointed by Camille to run the agency. His real name is Holden Pennylane.[7] He has a daughter named Claire Pennylane, who also works with Cloud 7. It is unknown what had happened to his wife, but it\'s assumed he\'s a widower before the show started. As part of finding out who is responsible for killing Prince Sparda, Mister was pretending to be under the friendly auspices of DTI\'s Chairman Taylor to avenge the prince\'s death by getting the chairman to confess his involvement with Duke Rand.[2][6] His symbol is a Top hat token when he issues orders from Cloud 7 HQ.[5] Claire Pennylane (, Kureia Peniirein?) is the daughter of Mister and is a member of Cloud 7, running dispatches to call for Jack and Rowe to Cloud 7 HQ whenever there is a debriefing. She sometimes go on the field on missions whether either Jack or Rowe need some manpower. The opening sequence of the L/R, "Go where no ones gone before" by Billy Preston, was released on a CD single on February 3, 2003 under the JVC Victor label.[8] The ending sequence of L/R, "Negai no Toki" by Mikako Takahashi, was released on January 22, 2003 under the same label.[9] Two OSTs were released on the show, consisting of VOCAL SIDE and INST SIDE. VOCAL SIDE was released on February 21, 2003 with 13 tracks under JVC Victor.[10][11] INST SIDE was released on the same date with 18 tracks under the same label.[12][13] Two Drama CDs were released consisting of L SIDE and the R SIDE. The L SIDE was released on March 21, 2003 under JVC Victor.[14] The R SIDE was released on the same day.[15] The premise centers on some missions from Jack and Rowe\'s perspectives. Both of these CDs have the TV version of "Go where no ones gone before" while the VOCAL SIDE has the full version. L/R had originally aired on Fuji Television from January 8, 2003 to March 26, 2003 without the fourth episode, making it a 12 episode run.[16] Another run was placed on AT-X from July 17, 2006 to October 9, 2006 with the full run of 13 episodes including the DVD-only episode "Sweet enemies in the same desert".[17][18] Production of the series was done under TNK.[19] It is clear that Director Itsuro Kawasaki and Producer Akahiro Kawamura were very much influenced by 60\'s British Rock scene in the creation of the series, especially by The Beatles. From the main character\'s names Rowe Rickenbacker & Jack Hofner (John Lennon used a Rickenbacker 325 Guitar, while Paul McCartney\'s guitar of choice was a Hfner 500/1 "violin bass" (which was also the code name for Jack\'s Car, Rowe\'s car was code named "Cold Turkey" which is also the name of a John Lennon song) to Cloud_7\'s assistant, Claire "Pennylane". Episode 5 introduced a young girl, Layla (as in the song of the same name by Derek and The Dominoes - that was inspired by Pattie Boyd, the wife of both George Harrison & Eric Clapton). The group of bombers who came from Ivory in Episode 10 all have the same first names as The Rolling Stones. There are many other classic British Rock names and influences laced throughout the series. Additionally, the song soundtracks, aside from the original theme-song by Billy Preston, consisted a group of 60\'s and 70\'s style British Rock sound-alike pieces very much influenced by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and even Herman\'s Hermits. Jonathan Klein, the English Language Producer for L/R, had mentioned at anime conventions that the Japanese Producer, Akahiro Kawamura, had originally wanted to use actual Beatles songs in the L/R soundtrack, since music licensing fees for old songs are far less expensive in Japan than they are in the rest of the world. However, the idea was put to rest early on in the production of the series when it was explained to Kawamura, that the cost to license those same songs for an American and European DVD release of L/R would raise the production cost by several million dollars, even if they could even secure permission from the rights holders. It was therefore agreed that original songs with a classic British Rock style would be used instead. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network commented that it was an "undercooked" show, but had a good dub while it had trouble with episode structure and plot progression.[1] He also said that the opening theme song by Billy Preston was catchy because it\'s "probably one of the best anime theme songs from the past five years, mostly because it doesn\'t sound like an anime theme song".[1] Adam Arseneau felt the series was "too dull to be intriguing or compelling, but too comfortable and easygoing to be a total failure".[20] The reviewer for AnimePRO compared the "fluid and loose" exaggerated actions and fight scenes to Lupin III, and enjoyed the rapport between Jack and Rowe.[21] They felt that the second volume had the right blend of action, an engaging story, and the right amount of humour.[22] Andrew MacLennan enjoyed the use of a British cast for the English dub, feeling it added to the espionage atmosphere, but felt that the story was not sufficiently engaging for an adult audience, despite the M rating.[23] Tiffani Nadeau praised VOCAL SIDE\'s arrangement, saying that the CD flowed well from one track to the next,[24] and Patrick King praised the variety in the songs, feeling the CD held up well even without the context of the series.[25]'

aS"The border pipes are a type of bagpipe related to the Scottish Great Highland Bagpipe. It is perhaps confusable with the Scottish smallpipe, although it is a quite different and much older instrument. Although most modern Border pipes are closely modelled on similar historic instruments, the modern Scottish smallpipes are a modern reinvention, inspired by historic instruments but largely based on Northumbrian smallpipes in their construction. The name, which is modern, refers to Scotland's border country, where the instrument was once common, so much so that many towns there used to maintain a piper. The instrument was found much more widely than this, however; it was noted as far north as Aberdeenshire, south of the Border in Northumberland and elsewhere in the north of England. Indeed, some late 17th century paintings, such as a tavern scene by Egbert van Heemskerck, probably from south-eastern England, show musicians playing such instruments. Other names have been used for the instrument: Lowland pipes and reel pipes in Scotland, and in Northumberland. However, the term reel pipes historically refers to instruments similar to Highland pipes, but primarily intended for indoor use. While the instrument had been widespread in the 18th century, by the late 19th century it was no longer played. There was an attempt to revive it in Northumberland in the 1920s, and the term half-long pipes is now used to refer specifically to surviving examples from this period. The instrument consists of a chanter which plays the melody, drones which play a constant unchanging harmony, a bag which holds the air to blow drones and chanter, and a set of bellows to supply air to the bag. An early photograph from Northumberland, c. 1859, shows the instrument well.[1] The instrument has a conical-bored chanter, in contrast to the cylindrically-bored Scottish smallpipe. The modern instruments are louder than the Scottish smallpipe, though not as loud as the Great Highland Bagpipe; they blend well with string instruments.[2][3] The chanter has a thumb hole and seven finger-holes. The compass of the chanter is nine notes, from G to a, though a few higher notes are obtainable on some chanters by 'pinching' and overblowing. As with the Highland pipes, the basic scale is a mixolydian scale on A. Some chanters can play chromatic notes however, and some old tunes, for instance Bold Wilkinson or Wat ye what I got late yestreen, suggest a dorian scale may also sometimes have been used, requiring minor third instead of the major third of the mixolydian scale. This could be achieved by cross-fingering or half-holing. Some instruments are made in other pitches, typically B flat or G, rather than A. The instrument has three cylindrically bored drones inserted into the pipebag by a common stock, typically tuned A, a, e', or A, a, a. In contrast, the Great Highland Bagpipe has each drone in a separate stock. The drone tuning A, e, a was used in half-long pipes in the early 20th century, and though still rare, sets are now beginning to be made with this drone tuning again. The bag is not filled with breath from the player's mouth, but instead is supplied with dry air, from a set of bellows strapped under the player's right arm. This keeps the reeds drier, which helps keep the instrument in tune. There is a distinct body of music for the instrument - many of these tunes survived in the fiddle and Northumbrian smallpipe repertoire after the playing of Border pipes died out in the mid-19th century. Others survive in manuscript sources from the 18th and 19th century. Most notably, the William Dixon manuscript, dated 1733, from Stamfordham in Northumberland, was identified as Border pipe music by Matt Seattle in 1995, and published by him with extensive notes.[4] The book contains forty tunes, almost all with extensive variation sets. Some of these are limited to a single octave, and many of this group correspond closely to tunes for Northumbrian smallpipes known from early 19th century sources - Apprentice Lads of Alnwick is one of these; others are melodically and harmonically richer - using the full nine-note compass and the G major subtonic chord - a fine example of this group is Dorrington. Another very early, though limited, source is George Skene's manuscript fiddle book of 1715, from Aberdeenshire. Besides settings for fiddle, some playable on the pipes, it contains four pieces explicitly stated to be in bagpipe style, all variation sets on Lowland tunes. Another early 18th century source, though limited, is Thomas Marsden's 1705 collection of Lancashire Hornpipes, for fiddle;[5] one clear example of a pipe tune here is Mr Preston's Hornpipe, with a characteristic nine-note compass. Significantly, this tune is in the Dorian mode on A, with C natural throughout, rather than the Mixolydian mode of the Dixon tunes. Several Border pipe tunes, including The English Black and the Grey, Bold Wilkinson and Galloping over the Cowhill, were copied in the 19th century by John Stokoe from the mid-18th century John Smith MS, now lost, from Northumberland. Contemporary with this, some tunes in James Oswald's Caledonian Pocket Companion ostensibly for flute or violin, are identifiable as Border Pipe tunes. Another important source is the Vickers fiddle manuscript from Northumberland - many tunes in this have the characteristic nine-note compass of pipe tunes. A later Scottish source, from the early 19th century, is Robert Riddell's Collection of Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes - besides some tunes for fiddle and some for smallpipes, others, such as Torphichen's Rant, clearly have the range and the idiom of Border pipe tunes. The smallpipe manuscript of Robert Bewick of Gateshead, besides many smallpipe tunes and transcribed fiddle tunes, contains several 9-note tunes, now identified as Border pipe music. Some of the smallpipe tunes in Peacock's book, from the early 19th century, are in the Lydian mode, with a tonic of c, but with one sharp in the key signature; these - 'Bobby Shaftoe' is one - make more musical sense in the major mode with an f natural, viewed as adaptations from originals for Border pipes. The Peacock, John Smith and some of the Bewick tunes are reproduced in the FARNE archive.[6] These tunes display several features distinguishing them from music for fiddle, Northumbrian pipes and Highland pipes. The nine-note modal scale, usually mixolydian, with a compass from the subtonic up to the high tonic, separates them clearly from most fiddle and smallpipe tunes. In particular, the interval of an augmented fourth, difficult on the fiddle, is much commoner in these tunes. The compass of fiddle tunes is generally wider, while the older smallpipe tunes have an 8-note range from the tonic up to an octave higher. One complication is the long tradition in Scotland of writing tunes to be played on the fiddle, but 'in bagpipe style', often with the strings retuned to imitate drones; 18th century examples of these can fit well on Border pipes, and may well have been intended as imitations of this instrument. Further, an important difference between the music of the Border pipes and of the Great Highland Bagpipe is that many melodic figures in older Border pipe music typically move stepwise or in thirds rather than by wide intervals, and lack the multiple repeated notes found in many Highland pipe tunes. This suggests that in contrast to the Highland pipes, Border pipe music neither needed, nor greatly used, the complex graces which are so characteristic of Highland pipe music. Modern attempts to reconstruct a musically valid playing style for Border music such as the Dixon tunes have been very successful, and several respected pipers play in such styles.[7] These are characterised by simple gracings, used sparingly, mostly either for rhythmic emphasis or to separate repeated notes. N>B> Although there are some recognisable 9 note pipe tunes included in Skene's manuscript of 1715, his collection appears to be of fiddle music, rather than pipe music The Border Pipes have been taken up by many groups of pipers who were looking for a suitable instrument with which to play their music. This has not just been by musicians who play the music of the Scottish borders. For example, in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, highland pipers have, for generations, longed to play with their fiddling family and neighbors. With the increased availability of Border pipes, Highland pipers have found a new way to integrate themselves into their own musical culture.[8] As the modern instrument is still fairly newly revived, ideas on playing styles are still evolving, and naturally depend on the kind of music being played. The Lowland and Border Pipers' Society was formed in 1982 and has played a large part in the revival of the instrument and its music. In Northumberland, the Northumbrian Pipers' Society has played a similar role for both Border pipes and Northumbrian smallpipes. The instrument is now once again widely played, and the original Border repertoire for the instrument, particularly the Dixon tunes, is becoming better known."

aS'Swiss mercenaries (Reislufer) were notable for their service in foreign armies, especially the armies of the Kings of France, throughout the Early Modern period of European history, from the Later Middle Ages into the Age of the European Enlightenment. Their service as mercenaries was at its peak during the Renaissance, when their proven battlefield capabilities made them sought-after mercenary troops. In William Shakespeare\'s Hamlet, Act IV, Scene 5, Swiss mercenaries are called "Switzers" (Switzer is actually what the Swiss were called in English until the 19th century). During the Late Middle Ages, mercenary forces grew in importance in Europe, as veterans from the Hundred Years War and other conflicts came to see soldiering as a profession rather than a temporary activity, and commanders sought long-term professionals rather than temporary feudal levies to fight their wars. Swiss mercenaries (Reislufer) were valued throughout Late Medieval Europe for the power of their determined mass attack in deep columns with the pike and halberd. Hiring them was made even more attractive because entire ready-made Swiss mercenary contingents could be obtained by simply contracting with their local governments, the various Swiss cantonsthe cantons had a form of militia system in which the soldiers were bound to serve and were trained and equipped to do so. Some Swiss also hired themselves out individually or in small bands. The warriors of the Swiss cantons had gradually developed a reputation throughout Europe as skilled soldiers, due to their successful defense of their liberties against their Austrian Habsburg overlords, starting as early as the late thirteenth century, including such remarkable upset victories over heavily armoured knights as Morgarten and Laupen. This was furthered by later successful campaigns of regional expansion (mainly into Italy). By the fifteenth century they were greatly valued as mercenary soldiers, particularly following their series of notable victories in the Burgundian Wars in the latter part of the century. The standing mercenary army of king Matthias Corvinus of Hungary ( Black Army of Hungary 1458-1490 ) also contained Swiss pikemen units, who were held in high honour by the king.[1] As a result, bands of men, sometime acting independently, other times under the banners of their cantons, marched off to foreign lands to fight in the causes of others, for pay. The native term Reislufer literally means "one who goes to war" and is derived from Middle High German Reise, meaning "military campaign". The Swiss, with their head-down attack in huge columns with the long pike, refusal to take prisoners, and consistent record of victory, were greatly feared and admiredfor instance, Machiavelli addresses their system of combat at length in The Prince. The Valois Kings of France, in fact, considered it a virtual impossibility to take the field of battle without Swiss pikemen as the infantry core of their armies. (Although often referred to as "pikemen", the Swiss mercenary units also contained halberdiers as well until several decades into the sixteenth century, as well as a small number of skirmishers armed with crossbows or crude firearms to precede the rapid advance of the attack column.) The young men who went off to fight, and sometimes die, in foreign service had several incentiveslimited economic options in the still largely rural cantons; adventure; pride in the reputation of the Swiss as soldiers; and finally what military historian Sir Charles Oman describes as a pure love of combat and warfighting in and of itself, forged by two centuries of conflict. Until roughly 1490, the Swiss had a virtual monopoly on pike-armed mercenary service. However, after that date, the Swiss mercenaries were increasingly supplemented by imitators, chiefly the Landsknechts. Landsknechts were Germans (at first largely from Swabia) and became proficient at Swiss tactics to produce a force that filled the ranks of European armies with mercenary regiments for decades. Although the Landsknechts were never quite as redoubtable as the Swiss, they were much more readily available for hire, as after 1515 the Swiss pledged themselves to neutrality, other than regarding Swiss soldiers serving in the ranks of the Royal French army. The Landsknecht, however, would serve any paymaster, even, at times, enemies of the Holy Roman Emperor (and Landsknechts at times even fought each other on the battlefield). The Landsknecht assumed the bright, garish soldier\'s outfits of the Swiss, and in fact soon outdid the Swiss in the flamboyance of their military dress. The Swiss were not flattered by the imitation, and the two bodies of mercenaries immediately became bitter rivals over employment and on the battlefield, where they were often opposed during the major European conflict of the early sixteenth century, the Great Italian Wars. Although the Swiss generally had a significant edge in a simple "push of pike", the resulting combat was nonetheless quite savage, and known to Italian onlookers as "bad war". Period artists such as Hans Holbein attest to the fact that two such huge pike columns crashing into each other could result in a maelstrom of battle, and ghastly casualties on both sides. Despite the competition from the Landsknechts, and imitation by other armies (most notably the Spanish, which adopted pike-handling as one element of its tercios), the Swiss fighting reputation reached its zenith between 1480 and 1525, and indeed the Battle of Novara, fought by Swiss mercenaries, is seen by some as the perfect Swiss battle. Even the close defeat at the terrible Battle of Marignano in 1515, the "Battle of Giants", was seen as a victory of sorts for Swiss arms due to the ferocity of the fighting and the good order of their withdrawal. Nonetheless, the repulse at Marignano presaged the decline of the Swiss form of pike warfareeventually, the two-century run of Swiss victories ended in 1522 with complete disaster at the Battle of Bicocca when combined Spanish Tercios and Landsknecht forces decisively defeated them using fortifications and new technology (i.e. handguns). It can be argued that it was arroganceoverconfidence in their own supposed invincibilitywhich defeated the Swiss as much as the armed forces of their enemies, for at Bicocca, the Swiss mercenaries, serving the French king, attempted repeatedly to frontally storm an impregnable defensive position, only to be mown down by small-arms and artillery fire. Never had the Swiss suffered such awful casualties while being unable to inflict much damage upon their foe. Arrogance and overconfidence were at play here, but another consideration was economicmany of the Swiss mercenaries were still farmers, and needed to return home from campaign quickly in order to work the fields. This meant they often rushed, unthinking, into ill-advised battles in the hopes they would crush the enemy of their employer, collect bounty, get paid, and march home to work their fields[citation needed]. The early contingents of Swiss mercenary pikemen organized themselves rather differently than the cantonal forces. In the cantonal forces, their armies were usually divided into the Vorhut (vanguard), Gewalthut (center) and Nachhut (rearguard), generally of different sizes. In mercenary contingents, although they could conceivably draw up in three similar columns if their force was of sufficient size, more often they simply drew up in one or two huge columns which deployed side by side, forming the center of the army in which they served. Likewise, their tactics were not very similar to those used by the Swiss cantons in their brilliant tactical victories of the Burgundian Wars and Swabian War, in which they relied on maneuver at least as much as the brute force of the attack columns. In mercenary service they became much less likely to resort to outmaneuvering the enemy and relied more on a straightforward steamroller assault. Such deep pike columns could crush lesser infantry in close combat and were invulnerable to the effects of a cavalry charge, but they were vulnerable to firearms if they could be immobilized (as seen in the Battle of Marignano). The Swiss mercenaries did deploy crossbows, handguns and artillery of their own, however these always remained very subsidiary to the pike and halberd square. Despite the proven armour-penetration capability of firearms, they were also very inaccurate, slow-loading, and susceptible to damp conditions, and did not fit well with the fast-paced attack tactics used by the Swiss mercenary pike forces. The Swiss remained primarily pikemen throughout the sixteenth century, but after that period they adopted similar infantry formations and tactics to other units in the armies in which they served. Accordingly, their tactics became less unique, and they took a normal place in the battle line amongst the other infantry units. In the end, as proven at Marignano and Bicocca, the pike attack of the Swiss mercenaries proved to be too vulnerable to firearms wielded by Spanish and Landsknecht arquebusiers and the earthworks and artillery of the French. These arquebusiers and heavy cannons scythed down the close-packed ranks of the Swiss squares in bloody heapsat least, as long as the Swiss attack could be bogged down by earthworks or cavalry charges, and the shooters were backed up by Spanish and/or Landsknecht pikemen to defend them if necessary from the Swiss in close combat. Other stratagems could also take the Swiss pikemen at a disadvantage. For instance, the Spanish rodeleros, also known as Sword and Buckler Men, armed with steel rodelas and side-swords, often wearing a helmet and a breastplate, were much better armed and armoured for man-to-man close combat than the Swiss. Accordingly, they could heavily defeat the Swiss if their pike column could be disorganized so that the rodeleros could dash under the unwieldy pikes of the Swiss and stab the lightly armoured, shieldless Swiss infantry. Landsknechts, using a formation similar to that of the Swiss, were defeated with terrible slaughter by the Spanish rodeleros at the Battle of Ravenna. It should be noted, however, that this required disorganization of the pike column, and Swiss pike columns which retained good formation were able to heavily defeat Spanish rodeleros formations in battles such as at the Battle of Seminara. Despite the end of their supremacy circa 1525, the Swiss pike-armed mercenaries continued to be amongst the most capable close order infantry in Europe throughout the remainder of the sixteenth century. This was demonstrated by their battlefield performances in the service of the French monarchy during the French Wars of Religion, in particular at the Battle of Dreux, where a block of Swiss pikemen held the Huguenot army until the Catholic cavalry were able to counterattack. Swiss soldiers continued to serve as mercenaries with many nations from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. The best known employer of these troops was the French army, where the Swiss formed an elite part of the infantry. The famed Swiss Guard regiment, the most senior of the twelve Swiss mercenary regiments in French service, was essentially identical to the French Guards in organization and equipment, other than wearing a red uniform as opposed to the blue uniforms of the French Guards. The Swiss similarly adopted the musket in increasingly large numbers as the seventeenth century wore on, and abandoned the pike, their ancient trademark, altogether at around the same time as other troops in the French army, circa 1700. They also served in the New World: Samuel De Champlain\'s map of the le Sainte-Croix (Saint Croix Island) settlement shows a barracks for the Swiss.[2] The Swiss mercenaries were recruited according to contracts (capitulations) between the French Monarchy and Swiss cantons or individual noble families. By 1740 more than 12,000 Swiss soldiers were in French service. During the remainder of the eighteenth century Swiss numbers varied according to need, reaching a peak of 20,000 during the Austrian War of Succession and falling to 12,300 after 1763.[3] The Swiss soldier was paid at a higher level than his French counterpart but was subject to a harsher disciplinary code, administered by his own officers. The basis of recruitment varied according to regiment - in some units recruits were drawn exclusively from the Swiss inhabitants of specific cantons while in others German or French volunteers were accepted to make up shortfalls in the number of available Swiss. During the latter part of the 18th century, increasing reliance was placed on recruiting from the "children of the regiment" - the sons of Swiss soldiers who had married French women and stayed in France after their term of service had ended. At the outbreak of the French Revolution the Swiss troops were, as foreigners, considered more reliable than their French counterparts in a time of civil unrest. Accordingly Swiss regiments made up a significant proportion of the royal troops summoned to Paris by Louis XVI in early July of 1789. A detachment of Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment was sent to reinforce the garrison of the Bastille prison shortly before it is was besieged by the mob. The Swiss and other royal troops were subsequently withdrawn to their frontier garrisons. Another Swiss regiment, the Chateauvieux, played a major part in the Nancy affair (mutiny) of 1790 and 23 of its soldiers were executed, after trial by their own Swiss officers.[4] The Swiss Guard however remained loyal to the last and was massacred on August 10, 1792, dying to protect Louis XVI when the mob attacked the Tuileries Palace, although the king had already fled. The eleven Swiss regiments of line infantry were disbanded the same year with the unemployed rank and file mostly returning to Switzerland. Following the occupation of Switzerland by French revolutionary forces in 1798, a project to raise six demi-brigades of Swiss infantry for French service was initiated. However recruitment proved difficult and by May 1799 only a quarter of the intended establishment of 18,000 had been raised.[5] Napoleon authorized the recruitment of a Swiss infantry regiment for French service in July 1805. A further three infantry regiments were created in October 1807, each including an artillery company. He specified that this newly raised Swiss Corps should comprise only citizens of Switzerland without "mingling in deserters or other foreigners".[6] The Swiss regiments fought well both in Spain (where they clashed at the Battle of Bailn with Swiss troops in the Spanish Army) and in Russia. During the retreat from Moscow Swiss losses amounted to 80% of their original numbers. The Swiss were allowed to keep the distinctive red coats which had distinguished them prior to 1792, with different facings identifying each regiment. One composite regiment of Napoleon\'s Swiss veterans fought at Wavre during the Waterloo campaign.[7] Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1815 two regiments of Swiss infantry were recruited as part of the Royal Guard, while a further four served as line troops. All six Swiss units were disbanded in 1830 following the final overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy. Another prime employer of Swiss mercenaries from the later 16th century on was Spain. After the Protestant Reformation, Switzerland was split along religious lines between Protestant and Catholic cantons. Swiss mercenaries from the Catholic cantons were thereafter increasingly likely to be hired for service in the armies of the Spanish Habsburg superpower in the later sixteenth century. The first regularly embodied Swiss regiment in the Spanish army was that of Walter Roll of Uri (a Catholic canton) in 1574, for service in the Spanish Netherlands, and by the middle of the seventeenth century there were a dozen Swiss regiments fighting for the Spanish army. From the latter part of the seventeenth century these could be found serving in Spain itself or in its possessions, and fought against Portugal, against rebellions in Catalonia, in the War of the Spanish Succession, War of the Polish Succession, War of the Austrian Succession (in the fighting in Italy), and against Britain in the American Revolutionary War. By the 1790s there were about 13,000 men making up the Swiss contingent in a total Spanish army of 137,000. Their final role in Spanish service was against the French in the Peninsular War, in which the five Swiss regiments (Ruttiman, Yann, Reding, Schwaller and Courteen).[8] mostly stayed loyal to the Spanishat the Battle of Bailn, the Swiss regiments pressed into French service defected back to the Spanish Army Swiss under Redingand were eventually ground down by years of fighting. The year 1823 finally saw the end of Swiss mercenary service with the Spanish army. As in French service, the Swiss fighting in the ranks of the Spanish army generally followed its organization, tactics and dress. The Swiss regiments were however distinguished by their blue coats, in contrast to the white uniforms of the Spanish line infantry. The Dutch employed Swiss units at various dates during the 18th century, although on a more limited scale than France or Spain. In 1745 three battalions of the Swiss Hirtzel Regiment formed part of the Dutch contingent sent to serve in England as allies at the time of the Jacobite uprising in Scotland that year.[9] Four regiments of Dutch line infantry retained Swiss elements until 1829.[10] Military alliances were banned under the Swiss constitution of 1848, though troops still served abroad when obliged by treaties. One such example were the Swiss serving under Francis II of the Two Sicilies who defended Gaeta in 1860 during the Italian War of Unification. This marked the end of an era. Since 1859, only one mercenary unit has been permitted: the Vatican\'s Swiss Guard, which has been protecting the Pope for the last five centuries, dressed in colourful uniforms, supposedly drawn by Michelangelo, reminiscent of the Swiss mercenary\'s heyday. Despite it being prohibited, individual Swiss citizens carried on the tradition of foreign military service into the twentieth century, including participation in the Spanish Civil War, usually on the Republican side. Swiss citizens also served in the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War, although purely on an individual and voluntary basis.[citation needed] '

aS'CHN FRA RUS UK USA United Nations Security Council resolution 1096, adopted unanimously on 30 January 1997, after reaffirming all resolutions on Georgia, particularly Resolution 1065 (1996), the Council addressed the current situation extended the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) until 31 July 1997.[1] The Security Council remained concerned that Georgia and Abkhazia had not resolved the conflict, particularly due to the position taken by the Abkhaz side. Noting the opening of the Human Rights Office in Abkhazia (established in Resolution 1077 (1996), respect for human rights was urged. Both sides had violated the Agreement on a Cease-fire and Separation of Forces signed in Moscow in 1994, and there were armed groups operating south of the Inguri River and beyond the control of the Government of Georgia. Meanwhile, the situation in Gali region continued to deteriorate. The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) peacekeeping force, also operating in the country, was expanded and its mandate extended until 31 January 1997. The situation in Georgia was in deadlock and there was no comprehensive settlement of the conflict, while the unacceptability of the Abkhaz position and the 1996 parliamentary election was underlined. In this regard, the intention of the Secretary-General Kofi Annan to strengthen the role of the United Nations in the peace process was welcomed. Both parties were called upon to achieve progress in negotiations and the resumption of high-level talks between both sides was welcomed by the Security Council. The resolution then addressed the situation affecting refugees returning to Abkhazia. Continued obstructions of this process and attempts to link it to the political status of Abkhazia were condemned along with demographic changes resulting from the conflict, and the right of all refugees and displaced persons to return was reaffirmed. Furthermore, the Security Council condemned all the ethnic violence and the laying of land mines and asked both parties to guarantee the safety and freedom of movement of UNOMIG, the CIS peacekeeping forces and international humanitarian organisations. Finally, the Secretary-General was requested to report to the Council three months after the adoption of Resolution 1096 on the situation in Abkhazia and the operations of UNOMIG, including a review of its future.'

aS'The Simple series are a number of series of budget-priced console games, published by Japanese company D3 Publisher and developed by a variety of companies, covering many systems. The price of the games in yen (not including tax) is included in the title of the series - for example Simple 2000 is about 2000. The games are usually characterised by their distinctive package design featuring artwork surrounded by a black border, with the game\'s title (usually prefixed by "The" in English) in a plain white font. The series name and volume are also displayed prominently. The early games in the PlayStation Simple 1500 series were generic interpretations of common video game themes, such as mahjong, tennis or racing. However the various series now cover many more original and unusual titles in addition to those based on concepts. Since the games are almost universally created on a low budget with a short development time, developers are able to experiment to some extent with titles such as The Daibijin, which has attracted attention largely due to its central premise of a giant bikini-clad woman attacking a city, rather than any gameplay or graphical merits. A producer at D3 Publisher has stated that the company will not be able to continue the Simple series on what was then "next-gen" systems (i.e. seventh generation).[1] The Simple Wii Series dedicated to the Wii console was recently created, however.[2] D3 employs a number of external developers for the series, some of the most prolific being Tamsoft and HuneX - most are smaller or little-known companies, although several games have been licensed from Taito for a (usually enhanced) re-release. Certain Simple series titles have attracted considerable interest outside of Japan for various reasons, either gameplay quality or a particularly unique idea - these include The OneChanbara and its sequels, as well as Sandlot\'s The Chikyuu Boueigun and Global Defence Force, which were based on their Gigantic Drive engine and were of considerably higher quality than most games in the series. Both of these series\' have had sequels for the Microsoft Xbox 360 video game console, although they were originally labelled under an \'X\' moniker (OneChanbara X and Earth Defense Force X) rather than a \'Simple\' one. Many of the PlayStation 2 Simple 2000 games have been released in PAL regions as budget titles by Midas Interactive Entertainment, Agetec or 505 GameStreet, usually under different titles and with new cover art; recently D3 Publisher of Europe has released several titles itself under the "Essential Games" brand. Additionally, several of the PlayStation Simple 1500 games were released in the US (by Agetec) and Europe (by Midas and Phoenix Games). Despite the recent establishment of D3 Publisher of America, the only game in the Simple 2000 series to gain a North American release was The Bass Fishing (as Fisherman\'s Bass Club); this is believed to be due to SCEA\'s more restrictive licensing policy.'

aS"Pateros /ptrs/ p-TARR-s is a city in Okanogan County, Washington, United States. The population was 643 at the 2000 census and increased 3.7% to 667 in the 2010 census. Pateros was originally established as Ive's Landing in around 1886 by Lee Ives.[6] Ives began farming the area near the confluence of the Methow and Columbia Rivers, with around 50 teepees of Native Americans and 20 Chinese miners also inhabiting the area. The first post office was built in 1895. In 1900, Charles Nosler acquired most of the townsite. He renamed the town to Pateros, after a town in the Philippines he previously visited. In 1903, the city consisted of four commercial establishments and nine residences and the town was sold to J.C. Steiner. Steiner vigorously promoted the town, making Pateros the principal rail shipping point between Oroville and Wenatchee. Pateros was officially incorporated on May 1, 1913. Wells Dam was constructed on the Columbia River several miles downstream from Pateros in 1967. Wells Dam is one of the many hydroelectric dams present on the upper Columbia River including Grand Coulee Dam, Chief Joseph Dam, Rocky Reach Dam, Rock Island Dam, Wanapum Dam, and Priest Rapids Dam. The reservoir created by the Wells Dam is named Lake Pateros and flooded much of the original city.

[8] Pateros is located in north central Washington and is in Okanogan County. Pateros has a population of 624 according to city data in 2009.[9] However during mid-July, thousands show up for Pateross annual Apple Pie Jamboree. There are events like Dragon boat races, basketball tournaments, and of course eating apple pie.[10] Pateros will celebrate their sixty- fourth anniversary of Apple Pie Jamboree in 2011. Apple pie Jamboree is a fun event for locals and coasties to participate in fun events that the proceeds from registration fees go to local students, clubs, and community groups. This is an event locals and vendors look forward to all year.[11] Dragon Boat Races: Multiple teams sign up and start training early to be in the Dragon Boat Races. Some business make use it as advertising, having employees represent the business in a fun work event. Twenty people row and to keep everyone rowing in rhythm, most of the time the smallest member of the team, beats a drum. These boats look like something from an Asian tradition and bring a unique sense to the City of Pateros. The racecourse is eight hundred and twenty feet, the team with the best time out of three tries receives metals. Practices are held a week before the races to help the team build a strong rhythm.[8] 3 on 3 and Other Activities: The 3 on 3 basketball tournament starts on the Saturday of the Jamboree at eight am, and goes until all the teams have played. The tournament is open to age groups anywhere from third grade to adult. A golf tournament goes on up at the Alta Lake golf course just five miles out of Pateros. Other activities such as the Jamboree Jog, bass tournament, a parade, quilt show, and the Wenatchee Youth Circus. A new addition to the 2012 Jamboree will be Jet Ski Races. Some of the worlds best jet skiers will be demonstrating their skills on Saturday and Sunday during the Jamboree. High jumps and back flips in the air are going to be the beginning of excitement for these freestyle racers.[12] Apple Pie and KFC: Apple pie is the heart of the whole event so an Apple Pie Baking Contest is the motivation to cook pies. There is a one hundred dollar prize for adult first prize and twenty dollars for the youth division. Slices of apple pie are then sold and all the money goes back to the community and students of Pateros. Also the senior class of Pateros High School does an annual KFC dinner fundraiser for their senior trip. It costs eight dollars and its a nice addition to the fun food, unique vendors and merchants.[11] In mid-August Tacoma Inboard Racing Association hosts the Pateros Hydro Classic. Each year racers come from all over the country to race on Lake Pateros. Hydroplanes fly at speeds up to one hundred and forty miles per hour. They are powered by eight cylinders and are so loud the whole town can hear them. A mile and a quarter liquid oval course is tight for fifty hydroplanes fighting for the gold.[13] The race starts at ten thirty in the morning. Fans watch from the grassy park on the side of the lake which is really the Columbia River. A fireworks display is the finale of a long day of races on the Lake."

aS'SVensson\'s ITS on KLH-10\nWelcome to SV!\n\nSV ITS.1648. PWORD.2660.\nTTY 11\n2. Lusers, Fair Share = 2%\n* In Internet slang, a luser (sometimes expanded to local user; also luzer or luzzer) is a painfully annoying, stupid, or irritating computer user.[1] It is a portmanteau of "loser" and "user".[2] In hackish, the word luser takes on a broad meaning, referring to any normal user (in other words "not a guru"), with the implication the person is also a loser. The term is interchangeable with the hackish term lamer. It can also signify a layman with only user account privileges, as opposed to a power user or administrator, who have knowledge of, and access to, superuser accounts. For example, The Sysadmin doesn\'t trust the end luser with a root account password. This term is very popular with technical support staff who have to deal with lusers as part of their job, often metaphorically employing a LART (Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool, or "clue-by-four".) The Jargon File states that the word was coined around 1975 at MIT.[3] Under ITS, when a user first walked up to a terminal at MIT and typed control-Z to get the computer\'s attention, it printed out some status information, including how many people were already using the computer. A patch to the system was then written to print "14 losers" instead of "14 users", as a joke. For a while, several hackers who disagreed on the appropriateness of the change struggled covertly, each changing the message behind the backs of the others; any time a user logged into the computer it was even money whether it would say "users" or "losers". Finally, someone tried the compromise "lusers", and it stuck. Later, ITS also had the command "luser", which attempted to summon assistance from a list of designated helpers. Although ITS ceased to be used in the mid-1990s, use of the term continued to spread, partly because in Unix-style computer operating systems, "user" designates all unprivileged accounts, while the superuser, or root, is the special user account used for system administration. root is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user); the usage lives on, however, and the term "luser" is often seen in program comments. On IRC, /lusers (which abbreviates "list users") is a common command to get the number of users connected to a server or network.[4] On Windows operating systems, lusrmgr.msc is the MMC snap-in used to manage local users. This article is based in part on the Jargon File, which is in the public domain.'

aS'Seldom Seen (1970 - 1996) was a horse that competed at the highest levels of dressage with his rider, Lendon Gray. He stood just 14.2 hh. American-bred Seldom Seen was trained and competed by the Olympic dressage rider Lendon Gray. The pony was originally intended to be a Pony Club mount for Kim, the daughter of Peg Whitehurst. He won USDF Horse of the Year awards from Third Level through Grand Prix, as well as an individual gold medal at the U.S. Olympic Festival in Syracuse, NY. He was also AHSA Reserve Champion at 2nd level and AHSA Champion at 3rd, 4th, Prix St. Georges, and Intermediaire 1. The impressive pony was retired in 1987, after winning the Grand Prix, Grand Prix Special, and Grand Prix Freestyle at Dressage at Devon. He died in 1996, at the age of 26. Although very small for a Grand Prix dressage horse, and described as an average mover, Seldom Seen was very successful, and was particularly loved by the public because he was an "average" horse that performed spectacularly. The pony was inducted into the USDF Hall of Fame in 2005. Google video of his retirement ceremony at Dressage at Devon in 1987. The video explains how he got his name.'

aS'Jnis Klovns (April 9, 1935  October 5, 2010[1]) was a Latvian chess Grandmaster. He was a career officer in the Soviet Army. Jnis Klovns won the Latvian Championship nine times (1954, 1962, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1975, 1979, and 1986), and participated in several Soviet Championships. He was a member of several successful Latvian youth teams during the early to mid-1950s, along with stars such as GM Mikhail Tal and GM Aivars Gipslis. He played for Latvia in two Chess Olympiads. In Manila 1992, at second reserve board (+0 0 =2), and in Istanbul 2000, at third board (+5 4 =4). Janis Klovans thrice won the World Senior Chess Championship, in 1997, 1999, and 2001. Still an active player in his seventies, he played regularly in tournaments all over Europe, and maintained a FIDE rating of over 2400, making him one of the strongest players in his age group. He was awarded the International Master (IM) title in 1976, and the Grandmaster (GM) title in 1997, following his win in the World Senior Championship. This achievement is notable in that he was probably the oldest player to be awarded the GM title for current achievements, rather than an honorary or retrospective title. This can be explained by the fact that although he was a strong master for many years, he was rarely allowed to play outside of the Soviet Union, and therefore had few opportunities to gain FIDE titles. Likely his career as a Soviet Army officer hampered his international chess opportunities. In 2001 he earned the International Correspondence Chess GM title.[2] He was married to the six-time Latvian Champion Astra Klovne and had two daughters.[3]'

aS'Tom Green worked with Walt Arfons to design and drive the Wingfoot Express, the jet-powered land speed record car. Green drove the car to a world record speed 413.20mph (664.98km/h) on October 2, 1964. Green\'s world record is often forgotten, as the mark was eclipsed three times in less than two weeks, including the first to break the 500mph (800km/h) threshold.[1] Green was chief engineer for a torque wrench manufacturer. Although Green\'s only racing experience had been a year of stock car racing in New Mexico ten years previously, he was greatly interested in aerodynamics. This dovetailed perfectly with Arfons\' interest in racing mechanics. The two met at a trade fair in Gary, Indiana in 1962, and Green recalls that "Within ten minutes we were planning our assault on the world\'s land speed record". Green shortly provided plans for a three-wheeled land speed record car, which had to be changed to four wheels to meet FIA rules; from there on there was little change until the car was finished. Green\'s emphasis was on reducing aerodynamic drag by lowering the drag coefficient and, especially, reducing frontal area by narrowing the track and using smaller wheels. His calculations indicated that the readily available surplus Westinghouse J46 jet engines would have more than enough power to drive the vehicle to over 400mph (640km/h). In order to find funding, Arfons and Green approached Goodyear. Green\'s mastery of aerodynamics was evident enough that Goodyear decided to fund his project; thus the name, Wingfoot Express, from Goodyear\'s trademark winged foot. Wingfoot Express\' cockpit was located centrally, just behind the front axle, covered with an acrylic glass canopy from in front of the driver\'s feet to behind his head. The front wheels were mounted within the bodywork barely further apart than the width of the engine, while the rear wheels were on outriggers and exposed to the air. Green estimated that the aerodynamic drag of the exposed rear wheels cost the car 20mph (32km/h), but since his calculations indicated that they already had much greater speed available than they needed, this was not viewed as a problem. A small fin rose vertically at the tip of the car\'s nose. Veteran drag racer Arfons was to drive the car for the record attempt, but a month before the scheduled run he damaged the ligaments in one hand, eliminating his chance of driving the car for the record. At this point there was no time to find another driver, and Green, who had never driven over 130mph (210km/h) in his life, was the logical choice because of his familiarity with the mechanics of the vehicle. At Bonneville, Green began his Land Speed Record career by easing the car around "the parking area" like any student driver. He followed with runs of 236mph (380km/h), 250mph (400km/h) and 275mph (443km/h). Greens first run using the afterburner sent the car to 335mph (539km/h) before salt crystals drawn into the engine threw it off balance. At this point, the team had exhausted the three days it had booked at Bonneville In 1964, Wingfoot Express returned to Bonneville for a week. On the last day they had available, October 2, 1964, Green and the car accelerated like a rocket, averaging 413.199mph (664.979km/h) in both directions and setting a new record. Within 3days, however, the record had been reset by Art Arfons. Although the final record run had demonstrated that Wingfoot Express clearly had much more speed available, Green decided to not push his luck and retired from competition, returning to his regular job. He is today a vice president of the company which produces wrenches for Snap-On. He continues to maintain contact with Arfons and they meet periodically. "I did offer to help Walt with his rocket car but the design was his own".'

aS"Novint Technologies, Inc. is a corporation incorporated in Delaware and based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States. Novint designs and builds haptic, or 3D touch, devices and software. Novint developed the Novint Falcon, the world's first consumer 3D touch device, which allows users to use their sense of touch in computing. Novint has two primary areas of focus, video games and professional uses of its technology. In video games, the Novint Falcon can be used to feel objects and events in the game, giving the player a more immersive experience. In the professional applications group in Novint, called the Advanced Products Group (APG), Novint's technology has been used to add the sense of touch to a variety of professional applications and projects. Novint's flagship consumer product is the Novint Falcon, a USB haptic device intended to replace the mouse in video games and other applications. The name of the Novint Falcon comes from the fact that the falcon is a predator of the mouse. The Falcon has removable handles, or grips, that the user holds onto to control the Falcon. As the user moves the grip in three dimensions (right-left and forwards-backwards, like a mouse, but also up-down, unlike a mouse), the Falcon's software keeps track of where the grip is moved and creates forces that a user can feel, by sending currents to the motors in the device. The Falcon's sensors can keep track of the handle's position to sub-millimeter resolution, and the motors are updated 1000 times per second (1kHz), giving a realistic sense of touch. The surfaces of virtual objects feel solid, and can have detailed textures applied to them. The weight and dynamics of objects can be simulated so that an object's inertia and momentum can be felt. The actions and interactions of a character in a game can be felt, such as the feel of a recoil of a gun, the motion of a golf club, or the accelerations of a car. The Falcon in essence is a consumer robot. It consists of its grip connected via three arms to a roughly conical body, which sits on a U-shaped base. Each of the three arms moves in and out of the Falcon's body. The default grip is a small spherical grip with 4 buttons on the top. The buttons are the Novint Logo for the primary button (which is similar to an 'N'), an upside down triangle (similar to a 'V'), a lightning bolt (similar to an 'N'), and a plus (similar to a 'T'), which collectively make the letters 'NVNT', the consonants in Novint's name and its ticker symbol as a public company. At the front flattened point of the Falcon's conical housing is a Novint Falcon logo that lights up in different colors to indicate the state of the device. The body contains 3 motors, each attached to one of the Falcon's arms by a cable that is wrapped around a capstan on the motor. As each of the 3 arms moves, an optical sensor attached to each motor keeps track of the movements of the arm. A mathematical function called a Jacobian is then used to determine the position of a three-dimensional cursor in Cartesian coordinates based on the positions of the arms. The position of that haptic cursor is therefore controlled by the Falcon's movements, and is used by the Falcon's software to determine the forces to be applied to the user. Currents are sent to the motors at the 1kHz servo rate to present the user with an accurate sense of touch. In this way, a force can be applied to the grip in any direction, up to the maximum force (over 2 pounds of force), every 1/1000 of a second. Novint has developed several grip accessories. On the consumer side, Novint developed a pistol grip, which is the shape of a pistol handle and attaches to the Falcon in place of the spherical grip. It has a main trigger button, and 3 side buttons. It was intended for use in First Person Shooter (FPS) games, but is generally an ergonomic grip that can be used for many applications. Novint has also developed several professional grips, including a 3 Degree of Freedom (3 DOF) grip that tracks rotations of the handle, two of which Degrees of Freedom are actuated and can present forces to the user. 3D touch software has been a primary focus of Novint since its inception, and Novint has had more focus historically on software than hardware. Novint's software was created to give users an accurate sense of touch in computing. Novint creates software in several different categories. It has developed a low level driver software called HDAL, which stands for Haptic Device Abstraction Layer. HDAL handles the low level communications between the Falcon and the computer. Novint has created a software layer above HDAL, called HFX (i.e. Haptics Effects), which is used for creating force effects in games. Novint has developed a variety of applications for its professional projects. Novint has also published a number of video games, some of which were developed by Novint directly and some of which were existing games in which Novint added support for the Falcon. An independent group has also developed an open source driver library[1] for the Falcon. The Falcon is packaged with 3 applications; a tutorial, a game called Newton's Monkey Business, and the Feelin It Sports Pack. The tutorial allows users to feel a virtual sphere that can have a variety of textures applied to it. For instance, choosing an ice texture presents a hard, slippery surface to interact with, while sandpaper feels rough, and molasses presents a viscous texture the 3D cursor can move through. The tutorial also shows the feeling of dynamics through a ball attached to a rubber band which can be swung around, and a simulation of catching a baseball with a catcher's mitt. Finally the tutorial allows a user to shoot a virtual slingshot which can be used to shoot cans off a fence. Newton's Monkey Business contains 24 mini games which contains a variety of mini-games showing many different types of game interactions. The Feelin It sports pack has several sports games, including bowling, a home run derby, a three point shootout, table tennis, and Feelin It Golf. One of Novint's earliest games was a free download called Haptics Life 2, a Half-Life 2 mod in which the mouse controls have been replaced with Falcon controls and 3D Force Feedback was incorporated. As a result, weapons recoils, the weight of carried objects, damage dealt to the character, and character and vehicle accelerations are all conveyed by the Falcon to the player. Each gun in the game has a different, tangible recoil. Novint has developed a variety of additional games across a wide variety of genres. As of 2009, Novint had published over 50 titles that work with the Falcon. A majority of Novint's game library is based on existing games that Novint added touch to. Novint is currently releasing 2 types of game support, FalconHD and F-Gen. FalconHD games are games in which Novint has licensed source code access for a game, and integrates forces directly into the game. F-Gen games utilize Novint's F-Gen application to add controls and forces into games. Mods, or modifications to games, will continue to be developed by Novint and its community, but mods will generally become classified through F-Gen support. F-Gen was developed to create a larger number of supported games and applications for the Novint Falcon with the understanding that the control and forces for many interactions in games/apps could be implemented without source code access. Novint therefore developed a system, F-Gen, where its community and users themselves could add support for games and applications, share their work, and get more game and application support more quickly, that is more robust. F-Gen was designed to be a community tool. It includes a strong scripting language and the ability to add F-Gen 'Tools', which can add functionality to F-Gen. The F-Gen drivers emulate a mouse, and are customizeable, making the Falcon work with any PC game or any PC application. Users can adjust the movement scales for the Falcon's control, and save settings for various games. Grip buttons can be mapped to different controls in games. Novint is developing a gesture recognition system, called the Gesture Cube or G-Cube, in which a user can easily access 36 simple to remember gestures to activate any key press or macro. A movement such as moving right then moving forward, will be able to turn on a flashlight (along with haptic cues to make the movements easy to control), while down-down could make the character crouch. The G-Cube will be able to be used universally in other applications, such as mapping forward-up to 'cut' while forward-down could be mapped to 'paste'. Beyond the FalconHD titles, there are 3 levels of game support for F-Gen. They are F-Gen Bronze, F-Gen Silver, and F-Gen Gold. F-Gen Bronze will just be basic mouse support with customized inputs. F-Gen Silver will have basic forces. F-Gen Gold will have strong force feedback support. With the F-Gen Beta release, all PC games can be played with the Novint Falcon. Novint and Novint's community are adding specific drivers within F-Gen to add more forces to many games. FalconHD Games include:[citation needed] Mods adding Falcon support are available for download, including: In 1995 Sandia National Laboratories, a United States government laboratory, bought one of the world's first commercial 3D haptic devices, and began developing haptic software. Sandia did core haptic research and research on how to use the technology for scientific visualization. It was one of the first companies in the world focused purely on the software side of the field of haptics. Anderson led the project at Sandia until 2000 at which point he founded Novint. Novint acquired an exclusive license to the technology and began to commercialize it. Novint's vision was that the technology could fundamentally change computing, adding one of our most basic human senses and experiences to computers. Given this vision, Novint was originally focused on consumer applications, but quickly found itself in a situation where the dot com bubble was bursting and the markets were collapsing. Investments in 2001 were difficult to come by for an early stage company, so Novint focused its efforts on higher end professional applications. Novint spent several years focusing on custom development for a variety of companies including Lockheed Martin, Chrysler, Chevron, Mobil, Aramco, Sandia National Laboratories, and Harvard University, among others. In 2004, the cost of 3D haptic hardware was still very high, over $10,000. Novint felt that to again move towards the consumer space, it would need to develop a consumer level hardware device itself. Novint took on the daunting challenge of taking a $15,000 haptic device, licensed from its partner company Force Dimension, and turn that device into a consumer level device, robust enough for gamers, yet still have the fidelity to be used in surgical simulations. By 2006 Novint had taken the expensive, high-end design, and working with Lunar Design, made a consumer level prototype. In June 2006, Novint went public on the OTC:BB under the ticker symbol NVNT. In late 2006, Novint put together a partnership with V-Tech to manufacture the Falcon in China. At CES in 2007, Novint announced plans to launch the Novint Falcon as a consumer device, and on June 18, 2006 (Tom Anderson's 32nd birthday) Novint launched the world's first consumer 3D touch device, having effectively brought the cost of the hardware down two orders of magnitude (1/100 of the original cost). At that point in time, Novint had a strong hardware solution, but felt that it needed better game support, which is currently one of the main focuses of the company. In May 2008, Novint made an agreement with Electronic Arts to license 7 AAA game titles. Novint then signed licensing agreements with other publishers and developers, including Valve Software. In June 2009 Valve released updates to Half-Life 2: Episode One, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, Portal and Team Fortress 2 adding game support for the Novint Falcon.[citation needed] In December 2009, Novint launched the first beta version of F-Gen, a tool which allowed mouse-like use of the Falcon in Windows. The program also included a scripting functionality that theoretically allowed users to integrate the Falcon into practically any game. In February 2010, Novint launched their second Beta version of their F-Gen software, integrating their proprietary G-cube functionality. Later that same month they released a small dll patch to fix a bug that had emerged in the button functionality. Both the beta and the patch were released only on the Novint forums.[2]"

aS'The Verziere (old-fashioned Italian word for "greengrocery market"; also known as Verzee, in Milanese) was the traditional greengrocery street market of Milan, Italy. The market itself has been relocated several times, and it is now in Via Lombroso, east of the city centre; the word "Verziere", anyway, still refers to the main historic location of the market, where it was held from 1776 century until 1911.[1] The new greengrocery market of Via Lombroso is more properly referred to as "Ortomercato" (another Italian word with the same meaning) or "Mercati Generali" ("general markets"). The "Verziere" area has been a symbol of Milan, and notable Milanese scholars such as Carlo Porta and Carlo Maria Maggi celebrated the Verziere in their works as the place where both the Milanese dialect and the Milanese culture was represented in their purest form.[2][3] The first Verzee was probably held in the main plaza of Milan, Piazza del Duomo, until the early 16th century, when it was relocated in the context of a thorough urban reorganization dictated by the municipal authorities.[4] The market was thus relocated to what is now Piazza Fontana, a prominent square adjacent to the Duomo, where the Palace of the Archbishop ("Palazzo dell\'Arcivescovado" in Italian) is also located. The 18th century scholar Carlo Torre mentions the Verziere in his essay Il ritratto di Milano ("Portrait of Milan", 1714), reporting that the area used to be a "wonderful garden".[5] The market was then moved from Piazza Fontana to the nearby Piazza Santo Stefano and then (in 1776) to its best known historic location in Largo Augusto.[2] Until the late 19th century, the Verziere could be reached by boat through Milan\'s canal system, which included a small port in an artificial inlet called "Laghetto" ("small lake"). The lake (as well as most of Milan\'s canals) has since been filled-in, but it is recalled in some toponymys, most notably "Via del Laghetto" ("Small Lake Street"). Between the late 16th century and the late 17th century, a votive monumental column, called Colonna del Verziere, was erected in what was the centre of the market. The market was moved in 1911 to the surroundings of Porta Vittoria, where it remained until 1965. In this less central setting, the Verziere could be expanded. Several buildings were realized for the market, most of which were later demolished; the most notable remnant of this incarnation of the Verziere is the "Palazzina Liberty" bordering the Marinai d\'Italia City Park, an Art Nouveau building designed in 1908 by architect Alberto Migliorini and that, over time, has hosted cultural events and has been used as the headquarters of Dario Fo\'s theatrical company.[2] In 1965 the market was finally moved to its current location in Via Lombroso. In 1966, a statue of poet Carlo Porta, realized by Ivo Sioli, was placed in the old Verziere location of Piazza Santo Stefano. The statue is usually referred to as "Carlo Porta al Verzee" ("Carlo Porta by the Verziere"). While the Verziere was celebrated as the "heart" of Milan by several poets and writers, it also had the reputation of being an unsafe district, populated by thieves, prostitutes, and tencitt (in Milanese, meaning "black stained people", in reference to the darsena workers who transported coal and wood). The darsena itself was so polluted that Franz Joseph I of Austria, in 1857, ordered that it be filled in for hygienical reasons.[6] Moreover, witches were believed to inhabit the district; their elder was known to live on the second floor of the "C dei Tencitt" ("House of the tencitt") building, in what is now Via Laghetto.[6] In fact, the Verziere Column, topped with a cross and a statue of Jesus Christ the Redeemer, was also erected with the purpose of opposing the malicious power of the "Verziere Witches".[7]'

aS"Gilbert James Everett (June 26, 1939  2005) was a Kansas bank robber whose crime spree in the southeastern United States during the early 1980s resulted in his being listed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list for over four years. Working on and off as a car salesman, a mapmaker and topographer, Everett was arrested in September 1980 following a bank robbery in Knoxville, Tennessee and convicted of armed robbery. However, escaping from federal custody less than a month later, he fled to Alabama in a stolen car in violation of the Dyer Act. After another bank robbery in Orlando, Florida, additional warrants against Everett in November was eventually added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list on May 13, 1981. Evading authorities for a year and a half, Everett robbed another bank in Sacramento, California in January 1983. Everett then went into hiding in the Alaskan wilderness. After three years Ranger Kevin Faler from the National Park Service at Hot Springs National Park, along with other officers, arrested him on August 12, 1985 and he was subsequently imprisoned.

aS'Ronald Ray Howard (July 22, 1973  October 6, 2005) was a convicted American murderer executed by lethal injection by the U.S. state of Texas. He was convicted of the shooting death of Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Bill Davidson after Howard was stopped driving a stolen car on April 11, 1992. Born in Houston, Texas, Howard dropped out of school in the 8th grade. He started, but never finished training in electrician, building maintenance, computer data entry, and heavy diesel mechanics. He was married with three daughters and one son. Howard\'s prior criminal convictions were burglary of a motor vehicle (6-year probated sentence) and 45-day jail sentence for theft. At the time of the crime, Howard was on probation. Trooper Bill Davidson stopped Howard, originally from the South Park area of Houston, Texas,[1] on U.S. Highway 59 about 5 miles (8km) south of Edna, Texas in a 1986 GMC Jimmy, as his vehicle had a broken headlight. When Davidson approached the driver-side window of the car, he was shot in the neck. Howard drove off but was apprehended later in the night, with a 9 mm pistol. The car was later found to be stolen. Three days later, Davidson died of his injuries. Drug tests showed that Howard had cocaine and cannabis in his system at the time of the murder. Howard also said that the rap music that he listened to had conditioned him to hate police officers. He had been listening to Tupac Shakur\'s "Soulja\'s Story" when pulled over. The song talks about the harsh life of a thug and a young black male being pulled over by a police officer and then shooting him. On June 8, 1993, Howard was convicted of capital murder and just over a month later sentenced to death. On December 18, 1996, however, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the sentence (but not the conviction) because a prospective juror had been erroneously dismissed. The appeals court ordered a new punishment trial, which took place on January 26, 1999; the new trial again sentenced Howard to death. This new sentence was confirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeals on December 19, 2001. On March 30, 2005 after appealing to the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit and the District Court for the Southern District of Texas his execution date was set as October 6. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, Howard continued to regret his actions and worked to stop at-risk youth following his lead. Howard was executed by lethal injection on October 6, 2006 in Huntsville, Texas.[2] When asked by the warden if he had a final statement, he looked at the family of Davidson and said: Yes sir, I do. To the victim\'s family, I hope it helps a little. I do not know how, but I hope it helps. I love you all, all of you. You know I love you. Thank you for bringing my children back to my life. Thank you. I love you all. I love you all very much. Thank you very much.[3] Howard was pronounced dead at 6:24 pm.[3]'

aS'Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport[6] (also known as Kingsford-Smith Airport and Sydney Airport; IATA: SYD,ICAO: YSSY; ASX:SYD) is located in the suburbs of Arncliffe and Mascot in Sydney, New South Wales. It is the only major airport serving Sydney, and is a primary hub for Qantas, as well as a secondary hub for Virgin Australia and Jetstar Airways. Situated next to Botany Bay, the airport has three runways, colloquially known as the "eastwest", "northsouth" and "third" runways. Sydney Airport is one of the oldest continuously operated airports in the world,[7] and the busiest airport in Australia, handling 36million passengers in 2010[8] and 289,741 aircraft movements in 2009.[9] It was the 27th busiest airport in the world in 2010. The airport is managed by Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL) and the current CEO is Kerrie Mather. Currently 47 domestic and 43 international destinations are served to Sydney direct. The area that the airport was situated was originally a bullock paddock.[10] Nigel Love, a former wartime pilot, was looking into the possibilities for aviation in Australia. He was interested in establishing the nation\'s first aircraft manufacturing company, this required him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. His search for a potential site eventually led him to a real estate office in Sydney which was aware of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club (that was kept as a hedge against losing its government-owned site at Randwick). It had been used by a local abattoir, which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. This land appealed to Love, the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. This grass which had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle running on it that it required little to make it serviceable to land aircraft. In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, gardens, a river and Botany Bay. Love established Mascot as a private concern, leasing 200 acres (0.81km2) from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was on 19 November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love. In 1921 the federal government purchased 161 acres (0.65km2) in Mascot for the purpose of creating a public airfield. In 1923, when Love\'s three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the federal government from the racing club.[10] The first regular flights began in 1924. In 1933 the first gravel runways were built. Cooks River was diverted away from the area in 194752 to provide more land for the airport and other small streams were filled. When Mascot was declared an aerodrome in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport, in 1953 it was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport[citation needed] in honour of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, who was a pioneering Australian aviator. Up to the early sixties the majority of Sydney-siders referred to the airport as Mascot. The first paved runway was 07/25 and the next one constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L), jutting into Botany Bay, starting in 1959, to accommodate large jets. 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft, although large four engine jet aircraft still periodically land on the runway from the east, when south-westerly winds are blowing in Sydney. 16R is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with 14,300ft (4,400m) paved length and 12,850ft (3,920m) between the zebra thresholds. By the 1960s the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. Much of the new terminal was designed by Paynter and Dixon Industries.[11] The plans for the design are held by the State Library of New South Wales.[12] The new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by Queen Elizabeth II. The first Boeing 747 "Jumbo Jet" at the airport, Pan American\'s Clipper Flying Cloud (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. The east-west runway was then 8300 ft;[13] in the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 and has undergone several refurbishments since then. The limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney\'s airport capacity for decades; eventually the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay. A proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was shelved in 2004, before being reexamined in 20092012 showing that Kingsford Smith airport will not be able to cope by 2030 The "third runway" (as it is known to Sydneysiders) remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many inner suburbs. The 1990s saw the formation of the No Aircraft Noise Party, although it failed to win a parliamentary seat. There has been general acquiescence in the arrangements for Sydney Airport that were introduced by the Howard government shortly after its election, namely to maintain curfews between 11pm and 6am, rotate runway operation and fan flight paths out, especially over water (especially Botany Bay) wherever possible and continue the use of noise abatement on aircraft on departure. In 1995 the Australian Parliament passed the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995, which limits the operating hours of the airport. This was done in an effort to curb complaints about aircraft noise. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11pm and 6am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the "shoulder periods" of 11pm to midnight and 5am to 6am, by Section 12 of the Act. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight, but limits movements by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed.[14] During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. As of 2009, fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of $550,000 applicable.[15] In addition to the curfew, Sydney Airport also has a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours.[16] In 2002, the Australian Government sold Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (later renamed Sydney Airport Corporation Limited, SACL), the management authority for the airport, to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd. 82.93 per cent of SACL is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of Macquarie Bank, Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 12.11 per cent and Ontario Teachers\' Australia Trust own 4.96 per cent.[17] SACL holds a 99 year lease on the airport which remains Crown land. Since the international terminal\'s original completion, it has undergone two large expansions. One such expansion is underway and will stretch over twenty years (200525). This will include an additional high-rise office block, the construction of a multi-level car park, the expansion of both international and domestic terminals. These expansionsand other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operationsare seen as controversial, as they are performed without the legal oversight of local councils, which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments. As of April 2006, some of the proposed development has been scaled back.[18] Sydney Airport\'s International terminal underwent a $500million renovation that was completed in mid-2010. The upgrade includes a new baggage system, an extra 7,300m2 (78,577sqft) of space for shops and passenger waiting areas and other improvements.[19] In March 2010, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released a report sharply critical of price gouging at Sydney airport, ranking it fifth out of five airports. The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest of $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 200809 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours. The report also accused the airport of abusing its monopoly power.[20] In December 2011, Sydney Airport announced a proposal to divide the airport into two airline-alliance-based precincts; integrating international, domestic and regional services under the one roof by 2019. The current domestic Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 would be used by Qantas, Jetstar and members of the oneworld airline alliance while today\'s international Terminal 1 would be used by Virgin Australia and its international partners. Other international airlines would continue to operate from T1.[21] In September 2012, Sydney Airport CEO Kerrie Mather announced the airport had abandoned the proposal to create alliance-based terminals in favour of terminals "based around specific airline requirements and (passenger) transfer flows". She stated the plan was to minimise the number of passengers transferring between terminals.[22] In June 2013 the airport released a draft version of its 2013 Masterplan, which proposes operating domestic and international flights from the same terminals using \'swing gates\', along with upgrading Terminal 3 (currently the Qantas domestic terminal) to accommodate the Airbus A380.[23][24] In March 2013 Air India announced plans to restart daily flights from Delhi to Sydney which will resume on 29th August 2013. [25] Sydney Airport has three passenger terminals. The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway, therefore connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times. Sydney Airport requires minimum connection times: The airport provides a shuttle service between the terminals at a cost of A$5.50. Terminal 1 was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now) and has been greatly expanded since then. Today it is known as the International Terminal, located in the airport\'s north western sector. It has 30 gates (Concourse B with 837 and Concourse C with 5063) served by aerobridges, as well as a number of remote bays. It can accommodate the Airbus A380, which fly routes to Singapore (Singapore Airlines), London via Dubai, Los Angeles and Hong Kong (on some routes) (Qantas), Dubai and Auckland (Emirates). The terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal also has an observation deck located on the rooftop. The terminal hosts six airline lounges: Two for Qantas, and one each for Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines and Emirates. The terminal underwent a major $500million redevelopment that was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to 254,000 square metres.[26] Terminal 2, located in the airport\'s north-eastern section, was the former home of Ansett Australia\'s domestic operations. It features 15 parking bays served by aerobridges and a number of non-contact bays. Today it serves Virgin Australia, Virgin Australia Regional Airlines, Jetstar, Tiger Airways, Regional Express Airlines, Skytrans Airlines, Brindabella Airlines and Qantaslink services operated by Eastern Australia Airlines. There are lounges for Qantas, Virgin Australia and Regional Express Airlines. QantasLink will be moving all operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 in late 2013.[27][28] Terminal 3 is a domestic terminal, serving Qantas and Qantaslink flights to Canberra. Originally, it was home for Trans Australia Airlines (later named Australian Airlines). Like Terminal 2 it is located in the north-eastern section. The current terminal building is largely the result of extensions made during the late 1990s. There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large Qantas Club lounge, along with a dedicated Business Class and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a \'Heritage Collection\', dedicated to Qantas, It includes Many collections from the Airlines\' 90 years of service, It also has a view of the airports apron and is used commonly by plane-spotters. It is located Adjacent Gate 13. Sydney Airport had a fourth passenger terminal, east of Terminal 2. This was formerly known as Domestic Express and was used by Regional Express Airlines; and low-cost carriers Virgin Blue (now known as Virgin Australia) and the now-defunct Impulse Airlines; during the time Terminal 2 was closed following the collapse of Ansett Australia. It is now used by DHL Express and Tasman Cargo Airlines as an office building. The dedicated Freight Terminal is located north of Terminal 1. It is used for international freight operations, except for Tasman Cargo Airlines\' trans-Tasman services. It is also used as overflow parking when terminal 1 gates are all occupied. The local, state and federal governments have investigated the viability of building a second major airport in Sydney since the 1940s.[39] Between 1987 and 2000 domestic flights through Sydney more than doubled to nearly 27 million, and international passengers served increased from 8million to 15million. The Sydney region passenger demand is forecast to reach 87million passengers by 2035, more than doubling, and to double again by 2060.[40] Close to half of all scheduled flights in Australia take off or land at Kingsford Smith. In 1998 the airport handled 45 per cent of international passengers in Australia.[41] The Federal Government has bought most of the required land in a proposed site at Badgerys Creek, west of Sydney. This site would be accessible by the Westlink M7 motorway. There are currently three proposals for the airport layout, featuring different arrangement of terminals in the centre of the proposed three runways. Despite acquiring almost all the land necessary for the building of the Badgerys Creek airport, and multiple studies and reports commissioned that recommend building the airport, in 1995 new airport leasing legislation was blocked in the Australian Senate, and construction was delayed until after the 2000 Sydney Olympics. All the major Australian airlines including Qantas indicated they would prefer additional development of Kingsford-Smith Airport. In 1998 most local authorities reversed their previous support of the new airport and protested against potential noise and pollution impacts. After the 2001 terrorist attacks decimated the air travel industry, the national government announced its belief that the current Sydney airport could accommodate additional air travel demands for at least another decade. Following this, the State Government released land for housing all across Badgerys Creek, effectively eliminating the site as a potential airport. The issue of a second airport for Sydney arose again after the Rudd government was elected in 2007. Convinced that capacity at the current airport will be exhausted, it sought a new site. It is believed that various options, including a freight-only airport operation, will be considered. Camden, converting part or all of Richmond and Canberra will be investigated for feasibility, while Bankstown and Badgerys Creek, according to sources, will not.[42] (a) The Darwin Sydney route includes data from May 2012. Hence this route may be ranked higher. For the year ending January 2012, Sydney Airport served 21,857,015 (1.9%) domestic, 2,006,365 (0.7%) regional and 11,765,273 (2.3%) international passengers. In all there were 35,628,653 (0.5%) passengers, a slight decrease from the year ending January 2011 which had 35,793,792 passengers.[3] The airport is accessible via the Airport Link underground rail line. The International railway station is located below the International terminal, while the Domestic railway station is located under the car park between the domestic terminals (Terminal 2 and Terminal 3). While the stations are part of the Cityrail suburban network, they are privately owned and operated by the Airport Link consortium. As a result, a single ticket to the city is $15.40 (day-return ticket $25.80), which includes an airport station surcharge (GatePass) of $12 ($19 for a day-return GatePass).[45][46] The trains that service the airport are regular suburban trains. Unlike special airport trains at other airports, these do not have special provisions for customers with luggage, do not operate express to the airport and may have all seats occupied by commuters (peak hours) before the trains arrive at the airport. Shuttle Bus will drive passengers to the city and deliver them to the door of their hotel. You can buy a ticket for a shuttle bus to your hotel from the information desk at T3 for $15. The cheaper option is to book online in advance, which will be around $12. Sydney Buses operates Route 400 from Burwood to Bondi Junction railway stations and stops at the International and Domestic terminals. It connects the eastern suburbs, Inner West and St George areas to the airport.[47] Private shuttle buses also service the airport from the Sutherland Shire, Blue Mountains and Central Coast. Sydney Airport, being located within a dense urban area, has road connections in all directions. Southern Cross Drive (M1), a motorway, is the fastest link with the city centre. The only other motorway, the M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney. A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north-south runway and three taxiways as well as providing access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith) connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car-rental company storage yards, long-term car park, heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the secured area for authorised vehicles only. The Airport runs several official car parksDomestic Short Term, Domestic Remote Long Term, and International Short/Long Term.[48] The International Terminal is located beside a wide pedestrian and bicycle path. It links Mascot and Sydney City in the north-east with Tempe (via a foot bridge over Alexandra Canal) and Botany Bay to the south-west. All terminals offer bicycle racks and are also easily accessible by foot from nearby areas.'

Funny or Die contains exclusive material from a number of famous contributors (e.g. Judd Apatow, James Franco) and also has its own Funny or Die Team, which creates original material for the site. Many clips on the site feature well-known actors (examples include Charlie Sheen, Ryan Gosling, Patrick Stewart, Daniel Radcliffe, Mila Kunis, Hilary Duff, Adam West, Jim Carrey and Jerry Seinfeld). Michael Kvamme, an aspiring young comedian, came up with a concept for a new kind of comedy site and the site was developed by Randy Adams. Videos are voted on by users of the site; those that are deemed funny stay, but those that are not "die" and are relegated to the site\'s "crypt". The title is a reference to the well known political cartoon, Join, or Die. The site\'s first video, "The Landlord", has received over 70 million views and features Ferrell confronted by a swearing, beer-drinking two-year-old landlord.[1] In June 2007, they received venture capital funding from Sequoia Capital,[2] and in June 2008, they announced a partnership with HBO.[3] Unlike other viral video sites, members of Funny or Die are encouraged to vote on videos which they view, with the options of "Funny" or "Die". The video then gets a score of the total percent of people who voted the video "Funny". If the video receives an 80% or greater "Funny" rating after 100,000 views, it gets an "Immortal" ranking. If the video receives a 20% or less "Funny" rating after 1,000 views, it is relegated to the Crypt section of the site. The Funny or Die staff can also select a rating of "Chosen One", which hides the score from the public, merely saying "Chosen One" instead. Aside from celebrity contributors such as Thomas Lennon, Demetri Martin and more, Funny or Die has a permanent stable of writers including Dan Abramson, Look what I found, Cory Matthews, Dashiell Driscoll, You\'re doing it right, Lauren and A General Nonchalance. Popular user contributors include Mikepattonfan (Sean Warhurst), Michael Kaddour, Joe Burton, Mpiddy, Michael Lake and more.[4] In February 2008, Funny or Die launched "Will Ferrells Funny or Die Comedy Tour Presented by Semi-Pro", in conjunction with the promotion of the movie Semi Pro. The tour featured Ferrell, members of the FOD Team and comedians Zach Galifianakis, Demetri Martin, Nick Swardson and Andrea Savage. Adam McKay and Will Arnett served as tour announcers. The eight-city tour hit college campuses in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, North Carolina and New York. In June 2008, HBO and Funny or Die announced that HBO had purchased a stake of less than 10% in Funny Or Die. With this, Funny or Die will be responsible for developing at least 10 half-hour episodes for HBO, and the companies may organize future comedy tours together. Regarding the agreement, Will Ferrell said, "I don\'t want to overstate the importance of this deal, but this is the missing link moment where TV and Internet finally merge. It will change the way we as human beings perceive and interact with reality. Okay, I overstated it. But it is an exciting deal."[5] In August 2008, FunnyorDie hired Andrew Steele, a twelve-year veteran of Saturday Night Live, and one of three head writers in recent years, to oversee content production and development for the site and for the HBO partnership.[6] Following the success of FunnyorDie, parent organization Or Die Networks[7] has spun out three additional verticals, based on FunnyorDies binary voting system. Funny or Die UK, launched on September 23, 2008, was a UK specific version of Funny or Die.[8] The patrons of the site were Little Britain stars Matt Lucas and David Walliams, in place of Will Ferrell.[9] The site worked in much the same way as the U.S. site, but featured a number of UK comedians, including Peter Serafinowicz, Kevin Eldon, Brendon Burns, Matt Berry and Dom Joly. Or Die Networks and UK partners Hatrick Productions chose to close the dedicated UK website due to financial struggles. The UK contents were consolidated in the main site and today the funnyordie.co.uk domain redirects to funnyordie.com.[10] Shredordie.com, launched October 23, 2007,[11] is an action-sports website OrDie Networks created in partnership with Tony Hawk. Users rate videos of members performing (or failing to perform) stunts by clicking either "Shred" or "Die." Shredordie.com was prominently featured in Tony Hawks Boom Boom Huckjam Tour. Pwnordie.com, launched July 1, 2008,[12] is a site devoted to all things video game, where users can post and enjoy videos about walkthroughs, cheats, reviews, or parodies of popular games. Users vote content either "Pwn" or "Die." Morraderir.com.br, launched July 28, 2008, and brings to Brazil the same home for comedy as FunnyorDie.com in the US. Users can view professional and user-generated content unique to Brazil and also from FunnyorDie.com, and upload their own videos as well. The site features celebrity content from Ivete Sangalo, Sabrina Sato, Diogo Portugal, Fernando Caruso, Luis Miranda and others. Eatdrinkordie.com, launched August 20, 2008,[13] is a culinary site where users vote videos on preparing and enjoying food as either "delicious" or "die." Tom Colicchio is one of EatDrinkorDies primary content partners, and the site has also featured content by Art Smith, Gary Vaynerchuk, Michael Chiarello, Jon Shook and Vinney Dotolo, and Sophie Uliano. EatDrinkOrDie.com no longer exists, and the website now links to FunnyOrDie.com.'

aS'The 1981 American League Championship Series was a best-of-five series between the New York Yankees and the Oakland Athletics. Due to a strike-shortened season, each team had to win two playoff series to reach the World Series. Oakland had swept the Kansas City Royals three games to none and the Yankees had beaten the Milwaukee Brewers three games to two in the 1981 American League Division Series. The Yankees swept the Athletics three games to none in the Series and moved on to the 1981 World Series, where they would lose to the Los Angeles Dodgers. New York won the series, 30. Tuesday, October 13, 1981 at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York In Billy Martin\'s return to Yankee Stadium (for the first time since the Yankees fired him in 1979), the Yankees drew first blood in front of their old skipper. Graig Nettles\' three-run bases-loaded double in the first inning was all the run support that Tommy John needed. John gave way to Ron Davis after six innings. Davis had an easy seventh, but the A\'s mounted a threat in the eighth where Martin tried some of his "Billyball" tactics. Dwayne Murphy walked with one out. On a 10 count, the next batter, Cliff Johnson, stepped out of the batter\'s box to replace his bat and took an unusually long time, as ordered by Martin. This rattled Davis to the point where he complained loudly to the home plate umpire and threw three more balls, walking Johnson. Yankee manager Bob Lemon removed Davis and brought in closer Goose Gossage earlier than expected to face Tony Armas. Armas was the tying run at that point and was also the A\'s leading home run and RBI man. Gossage retired Armas and Wayne Gross to end the inning and closed out the win the rest of the way. Wednesday, October 14, 1981 at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York With a 31 lead after 3 12 innings and American League ERA leader Steve McCatty cruising, the A\'s seemed headed for a 11 tie going back home to Oakland. It could have been worse, but Dave Winfield made a leaping catch in the second to rob Tony Armas of a homer. But, Graig Nettles led off the bottom of the fourth with a single and Rick Cerone was hit by a McCatty pitch. After Willie Randolph singled in Nettles, Jerry Mumphrey walked. Dave Beard came on in relief and proceeded to give up an RBI single to Larry Milbourne, a two-run double to Winfield, and a three-run homer to Lou Piniella. Beard gave up two more hits and loaded the bases after that, but Cerone flied out to end the disastrous inning. The Yankees now led 83. The Yankees added five more runs, three coming on a Nettles homer in the seventh, to complete the rout. Thursday, October 15, 1981 at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California Prior to the game, Bob Lemon inexplicably dropped Willie Randolph from the leadoff spot in the batting order to ninth. Randolph kept any ill feelings to himself and broke a scoreless pitching duel between Dave Righetti and Matt Keough with a solo homer in the sixth. That run would be all Righetti would need through six innings. Series MVP Graig Nettles plated three more runs in the ninth with a bases-loaded double resulting when A\'s center fielder Rick Bosetti turned the wrong way on his fly ball. Dave Righetti pitched six shutout innings and Ron Davis pitched two scoreless innings before giving way to Goose Gossage, who got the save. The most widely accepted debut of "the wave" occurred during Game 3, led by Krazy George Henderson. 1981 ALCS (30): New York Yankees over Oakland Athletics Columbia Park  Shibe Park  Municipal Stadium  Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum  Cashman Field  Cisco Field (proposed)'

aS'"Witchy Woman" is a song written by Don Henley and Bernie Leadon, and recorded by the American rock band Eagles. Released as the second single from the band\'s debut album Eagles, it reached #9 on the Billboard Pop singles chart[1] and is the only single from the album to feature Henley on lead vocals. "Witchy Woman" was started by guitarist Bernie Leadon who wrote it while he was a member of The Flying Burrito Brothers. Upon joining the Eagles, Bernie and Don Henley completed writing the song in the signature Eagles style and it was one of Henley\'s first songs he wrote for the Eagles. While the inspiration for the title and lyrics was based on various women they had met and remembered as seductive enchantresses, Henley had Zelda Fitzgerald particularly in mind after reading her biography.[2] The muse and sometimes genius behind her well-published author husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, Zelda was known as wild, bewitching and mesmerizing and was the quintessential "Flapper", as her husband dubbed her, of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties. In his novel, The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald embodies Zelda\'s uninhibited and reckless personality in the character of Daisy Buchanan.[3] Theories and speculation on Zelda\'s behavior were widespread, with lyrics in "Witchy Woman" referring to Zelda\'s partying excesses being detrimental to her psyche: "She drove herself to madness with the silver spoon", is a reference to Zelda\'s time in a mental institution and the special slotted silver spoon used to dissolve sugar cubes with Absinthe, the popular 1920s alcoholic beverage distilled from the wormwood tree and called "the green fairy" for sometimes inducing hallucinations. The song was conceived while Don Henley was living in an old house near the Hollywood Bowl, with his flat mate, Henry Vine (aka \'Blitz\').  The song, along with Desperado, was both used and referred to in an episode of the sitcom Seinfeld. In an episode of Dharma and Greg from the first season, Abbey, Dharma\'s mother, mentions that she dated Henley and is almost certain she is Witchy Woman. The song was used in a 2005 episode of the series Cold Case titled "In the Woods" (the episode was set during 1972, the year of the song\'s original release). It is also used in the movie America\'s Sweethearts to depict Catherine Zeta-Jones\' character as she is getting out of a limosine. '

aS"On the night of January 19, 2013, five people were found dead inside a house by police in South Valley, New Mexico. A .22 caliber rifle was used to shoot a woman and three children and an AR-15-style rifle was believed to be the weapon used to shoot an adult male when he came home later. A 15 year old male was arrested in connection with the shooting.[1][2][3] According to police, Nehemiah Griego first killed his mother with a .22 rifle at around midnight. His brother Zephaniah woke up and Nehemiah told him he had shot their mother, but his brother initially did not believe him until Nehemiah showed him her bloodstained face. He stated to police his brother became upset, and then Nehemiah proceeded to shoot him with the same rifle. He then went into the bedroom his two younger sisters shared and found them crying, and shot them both in the head. He then proceeded downstairs and waited for his father to return home, which he did at around 5:00am, upon which his son shot him multiple times with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle with a scope. In that statement of facts he gave to police, Nehemiah said that he had been having suicidal and homicidal thoughts, that he had obtained the guns from his parents' closet, that he had mailed a photo of his dead mother to his girlfriend, and that he had intended to drive off and use the guns to kill more individuals and ideally die in a gun battle with police. (The statement will only be admissible as evidence in court if he made it freely and voluntarily without coercion, and that he knew his attorney was not present and waived that right). Under the laws of New Mexico, those of his age charged with first-degree murder are tried as adults, though minors can no longer be given the death penalty or an automatic life-without-parole sentence. He had originally lied to his girlfriend and church officials that his parents were killed in a car accident, and later said that he discovered their bodies and drove off.[4] The five victims were a man, his wife, and three of their children, including two girls and one boy.[3][5][6] The man, 51-year-old Greg Griego, was a former pastor at the area's Calvary Church who was also a chaplain to the Albuquerque Fire Department, and his wife, 40-year-old Sarah Griego, were the father and mother of the alleged shooter, Nehemiah Griego. The children (9-year-old Zephania, 5-year-old Jael, and 2-year-old Angelina) were Nehemiah's younger siblings. The suspect is 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego. He was booked into Bernalillo County Juvenile Detention Center and was charged with two counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death.[5][7][8]"

aS'Thrill Drive is a street racing sim arcade game released by Konami in 1998. Taking place in either the U.S.A., Japan, or Europe, the player must race three other opponents to the finish line without crashing into objects such as pedestrians that suddenly appear or causing accidents as well as avoid police cars along the way. Also, like various Sega driving games such as Hang-On and OutRun, the scenery can change at any time. The player has an assortment of vehicles to choose from, such as a sports car, a sedan, a station wagon, an SUV, a convertible, a bus, and a truck. The game is notable for the special effects when a player crashes. The screen will show a broken windshield as if you had crashed into somethingas this would become a theme in later games in the seriesand show a violent image before resetting you at the place where you made the mistake. Upon crossing checkpoints, the music will change to something different, or positive. However, if a player crashes and resets, the music will change to a negative, dramatic piece. Also notable is when a player finishes a race depending on how much time was left on the clock. When this happens, the computer will rate your driving technique as well as add up how many accidents the player had and how much money in damage the player has causedand assigns a final rating, which can suffer badly if too many objects are hit or accidents are caused.

aS'The Afghan Campaign is a historical novel by the American writer Steven Pressfield. It was first published in 2006 by the Broadway division of Random House.[1] It is the story of Alexander the Great\'s invasion of the Afghan kingdoms (the Afghanistan of today) in 330BC through the eyes of Matthias ( in Greek), a young soldier from Macedonia, who narrates the adventures of the Macedonian army against the Eastern warriors. Matthias fights for Alexander the Great\'s infantry confronting ferocious people who, determined to defend their homeland, follow tough war methods. Many pages of the book are dedicated to Alexander\'s army\'s fight against the Persian Spitamenes ( in Greek), the Wolf of the Desert, whose army follows the barbarian war method contrary to their rivals who make war in array. Pressfield presents the brutalities and ferocities of both parties while he does not omit to refer to the vanity and voraciousness of Alexander the Great who in the last pages of the novel gets married to the Bactrian Roxanne ( in Greek), daughter of Oxyartes. Having thus safeguarded his rights in the kingdoms of Orient, he sets off to conquer India crossing the mountains of Indian Caucasus. He leaves behind him many thousands of footmen and horsemen (one fifth of his army) to deter the indigenous people from possible insurrections and outbreaks within the conquered land. Young Matthias from Macedonia follows his two older brothers example and enrolls in Alexanders cavalry together with his close friend Lygaios/Lucas ( in Greek).[2] This special convoy departs from Tripoli, Lebanon and after 125 days of marching meets the rear of Alexander\'s army. The hero takes part into his first battle and gets shocked by the atrocities of his adversaries and his own people as well. Noteworthy is the fact that the enemy, apart from its guerilla methods, recruits women and children to fight for their freedom. While marching, Matthias meets Shinar, an Afghan woman who, having abandoned her own people, offers her services as carrier of the Greek armys supplies. Nanguali is the barbarian warriors code; its three elements are: honour, revenge and hospitality. Their womens honour, if blackened, could be redeemed (turn back into white) only by death. Matthias stands up to Baz, Shinars brother, but fails to reach a compromise and is deceived by Baz, who in the end kills his sister and her baby. At the end of the story, Matthias is left with nothing  he has lost his family, friends, health and hope. Instead of returning home (his wife and son having been killed) as initially planned and having nothing to lose, he decides to follow the Greek army in its way to India. The absurdity of the war is revealed in all its grandeur. The novel was well received by critics who found it a "vivid, compelling tale about the challenges of the war",[3] and that through the characters we learn something about human nature.[4] '

aS'Spilotes pullatus, commonly known as the chicken snake,[2] yellow rat snake,[2] or serpiente tigre, is a species of large nonvenomous colubrid snake endemic to Mesoamerica. It is found in southern Central America, northern South America, and Trinidad and Tobago.[2] Adults may attain a maximum total length of 2.7m (8.9ft).[2] A specimen with a total length of 2.1m (6.9ft) has a tail 49cm (19in) long.[1] Dorsally, S. pullatus is black with yellow spots which may form crossbands. The tip of the snout is yellow. The head shields may be mostly yellow, or mostly black, or crossbanded with a combination of yellow and black, but the sutures between the shields are always black. Ventrally, it is yellow with irregular black crossbands.[1] The body is relatively slender and somewhat laterally compressed. The head is distinct from the neck. The eye is moderate in size with a round pupil. There are no suboculars, and the loreal is either very small or absent. There are 6 or 7 upper labials, the 3rd and 4th entering the eye, the last two very large. The dorsal scales are pointed and overlapping.[1] The dorsal scales are arranged in 16 (or 14) rows at midbody. Ventrals 198-232; anal plate entire; subcaudals 90-120, divided.[1] It tends to inhabit forested areas, and is often found near water.[2] It is mainly arboreal, but also terrestrial.[2] It feeds on a wide variety of prey, including small mammals, birds, and lizards. Including the nominotypical subspecies, the following five subspecies are recognized:[2]'

aS' French service British service Armide was a 40-gun frigate of the French Navy, lead ship of her class, and launched in 1804 at Rochefort. She served briefly in the French navy before the British captured her in 1806. She went on to serve in the British Navy until 1815 when she was broken up. She took part in Allemand\'s expedition of 1805. On 18 July, she captured and burnt a Prussian cutter to maintain the secrecy of the movements of the fleet, in spite of the neutrality of Prussia at the time. The next day, she captured HMS Ranger and burnt her. She then took part in the assault on the Calcutta convoy, helping Magnanime engage and capture HMS Calcutta. In March 1806, under Amable Troude, Armide helped repel an attack led by Robert Stopford at Les Sables-d\'Olonne. During the Action of 25 September 1806, HMS Centaur, under the command of Commodore Sir Samuel Hood, captured Armide, which was under the command of Captain Jean-Jacques-Jude Langlois, and assisted in the capture of Infatigable, Gloire and Minerve. Centaur lost three men killed and three wounded. In addition, a musket ball shattered Hood\'s arm, which had to be amputated. The wound forced Hood to quit the deck and leave the ship in the charge of Lieutenant William Case. Centaur also lost most of her lower rigging. In all, the British lost nine men killed and 32 wounded. Hood estimated that the French had 650 men aboard each vessel, inclusive of soldiers, but put off till later any estimate of their losses.[1] Armide arrived at Plymouth on 2 October 1806, where she was laid up.[2] In 1807 and 1808 she was in ordinary in Plymouth. She then underwent repairs between February and October 1809.[2] Armide entered British service as the 38-gun fifth rate HMS Armide. [1] In August 1809 Captain Lucius Ferdinand Hardyman commissioned her and assumed command.[2] In January 1810 Armide, under Captain Hardyman, and the 80-gun second rate, HMS Christian VII, Captain Sir Joseph Sydney Yorke, were stationed off the Basque Roads. On 10 January, they sighted a small convoy sailing from the le d\'Aix to La Rochelle. The boats of the two ships went in under small arms and grapeshot fire from a shore battery and captured a chasse-maree of about 30 tons. The tide was ebbing too fast to bring off the other vessels so the British burnt a brig, a schooner and a chasse-maree. This was regrettable as the all were fully laden with cargoes consisting of best quality wines and brandies, soap, rosin, candles, pitch, oil, pine varnish, and the like. The cutting out expedition suffered no casualties.[3] The captured chasse maree was probably the Felicite.[4] On 19 January Armide recaptured the brig Hope.[5] The next evening, boats from Armide and Christian VII pursued about 30 vessels that were coming out from the Maumusson Pass, between the le d\'Olron and the mainland, making for La Rochelle. The French convoy then ran aground close under shore batteries. Still, the British were able to take one chasse-maree and burn four, despite heavy fire from the shore batteries. The rest escaped and headed back from where they had come. Two French sailors died in the affair and Armide had one man wounded.[3] The captured chasse maree was probably Glorieuse.[4] On the night of 12 February, another convoy of ten vessels sailed from the Charente River and three chasse-marees went aground on the reef off the Point de Chatelaillon between La Rochelle and le d\'Aix. Yorke then sent in three boats each from Armide and Christian VII, plus two from HMS Seine, to attack them. Nine French gunboats, each carrying a 12-pounder carronade and six swivel guns, and manned with suffient men for 20 to 30 oars, fled from the British boats. The British captured one gunboat, killing two of her crew and wounding three, including her commander; two gunboats grounded and could not be retrieved. The British then burnt the three chasse-marees that they captured.[6] On 29 April Armide was in company with Daring when the captured the Aimable Betsie.[7] On 4 May, boats from Armide, with the assistance of boats from the 8-gun Cherokee-class brig-sloop HMS Cadmus, the gun-brig HMS Monkey, and the 12-gun gun-brig HMS Daring, attacked a French convoy of armed and coasting vessels off the le de R. Despite strong fire from shore batteries and the convoy\'s escorts, the British accounted for 17 ships, burning 13 of them and forcing four ashore. Armide lost three men killed and three wounded.[8] In August Captain Richard Dalling Dun assumed command. On 27 September, the boats of the 120-gun first rate HMS Caledonia, Captain Sir Harry Neale, the 74-gun Repulse-class third rate HMS Valiant, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver, and Armide, captured two laden brigs and burned a third that had taken shelter under the guns of a battery on the Point du Ch, near Angoulins. A force of 130 Royal Marines from the two ships of the line also took and destroyed the battery after engaging reinforcements on the way. The British suffered two men wounded, but killed at least 14 French soldiers in the battery alone.[9] The next day Armide, Caledonia, Valiant, Snapper, Arrow and the hired armed cutter Nimrod captured the San Nicolas and Aventura.[10] On 9 January 1811, Armide and Pheasant recaptured the Nancy.[11] Captain Francis Temple assumed command in September 1812.[2] On 16 January 1813, Armide grounded near two batteries on Point St. Jaques, Quiberon Bay. When the French hailed them, the pilot on Armide replied that she was the frigate USS President and that they required no assistance. Her crew managed to re-float Armide before the French discovered they had been tricked. Still, a court-martial reprimanded Temple, "dis-rated the master from his ship", and fined the pilot of all his pay, while also sentencing him to imprisonment in the Marshalsea for two months.[12] (This setback did not destroy Temple\'s naval career. He went on to rise to the rank of Vice Admiral of the White.) From 5 February 1813 to May 1815 Armide was under the command of Captain Edward Thomas Troubridge.[2] On 14 May, he brought her into Nova Scotia, together with a convoy of three store ships from Cork. On 7 August 1813 Armide captured an American schooner laden with munitions of war on the Rappahannock River at Windmill Point and with two ladies as passengers. Armide forwarded the ladies to their place of destination but kept their two male escorts and three sailors as British prisoners.[13] On 15 August, Armide was in company with Endymion when she captured the American privateer Herald of 230 tons burthen (bm), 17 guns and 100 men. She had thrown two guns overboard while pursued.[14] The next day Armide captured the French letter of marque Invincible, formerly the Invincible Napoleon. She was armed with 16 guns but had thrown ten overboard. She was of 331 tons burthen (bm) and had a crew of 60 men.[14] To prepare for the attack on New Orleans, in early December 1814 Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane hoisted his flag in Armide and took her together with the 38-gun frigate HMS Seahorse and the 18-gun Cruizer-class brig-sloop HMS Sophie off Pensacola to an anchorage at the Isle of Vaisseau at the beginning of December 1814. On her way down two American gunboats fired on Armide, which led to the Battle of Lake Borgne. Boats from the British fleet, under Captain Nicholas Lockyer of Sophie, and including Armide, captured the American flotilla. In the action the British lost 17 men killed, including one from Armide, and 77 wounded. After the British had succeeded in silencing American naval opposition, the British transported their troops 60 miles to Bayou Catalan (or des Pecheurs) at the head of Lake Borgne. The troops landed on 23 December and took up a position across the main road to New Orleans. While Captain Troubridge took command of the naval brigade ashore, Armide remained at anchor off the le au Chat. After their defeat in the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 the British withdrew. Cochrane left the British headquarters on 14 January, returning to Armide on the 16th. In February Armide was at Bermuda ready for passage home. She was broken up in November 1815.[2]'

aS"Protomarctus is an extinct member of the Borophaginae and a small terrestrial canine (Bear-dog) which inhabited most of North America during the Burdigalian stage of the Miocene epoch 20.415.9 Mya, existing for approximately 4.5 million years.[1] Protomarctus was named by Wang et al. (1999). It was assigned to Borophagini by Wang et al. (1999). One species, Tomarctus optatus, is known and was named by Matthew in 1924. The first specimen was found in Thomson Quarry, Sheep Creek Formation, Nebraska in a Hemingfordian layer. Protomarctus were short-faced, heavy-jawed canines usually massive in size. It would have shared its early existence with a variety of bear dogs like bone crushing canidae Aelurodontina, Tomarctus, Phlaocyonini, and Rhizocyon. Fossil specimens of two individuals' body mass were examined by Legendre and Roth. The first specimen was estimated to weigh 11.8kg (26lb). The second specimen was estimated to weigh 11.1kg (24lb).[2] Protomarctus specimens have been found in present day Nebraska, Colorado, as far west as California and as far southwsest as New Mexico.[3] "

The inn is located on Whidbey Island at the west end of Penn Cove just outside Coupeville, Washington. The Captain Whidbey Inn was built in the fall and winter of 1907 from Madrona logs and stone found on-site by Chris Fisher and his son Edward. The post and beam construction, with the log infill, sits intact as originally built. Larry Fisher, Chris Fishers great-grandson, still works occasionally on the inn. It was opened in May 1907 as part of a large recreation retreat then-called Still Park. The inn and park were developed by Judge Lester Still. The park also had camping, cabins, horse trails, tennis courts and a warm salt water swimming pool. A collection of pictures from that period remain in a history collection at the inn. The inn originally contained 15 sleeping rooms upstairs and a large gathering room downstairs with a two-sided fireplace. The fireplace was faced with native stone; it still forms the central meeting place for the inn. Daily steamers from both Seattle and Everett were the original links to the outside world bringing passengers, supplies and mail to the dock located at the eastward-facing front of the inn. Parts of the original dock and stone stairway can still be seen while walking the current pier. Automobile access was available via ferry before Deception Pass Bridge was completed in 1935; Judge Still is credited with bringing the first automobile to Whidbey Island. The vehicle can still be seen at the Island County Historical Society Museum. Over time, the Inn has served as a general store, a girls school, and a post office. The property returned to offering accommodations open to the public in 1946. Today, the inn appears very similar to the way it was when it was built. The original wood floors are still visible in both the lobby and the bar. The large gathering room has become the dining room, kitchen, and Judge Still's Tavern. Over the years, electricity as well as high speed cable and Wi-Fi have been installed and upgraded throughout the building. The original inn now houses two suites and 10 regular rooms upstairs overlooking Penn cove and the gardens. The original cabins are now gone and have been replaced by four waterside cabins with hot tubs and kitchens. Guests can arrive either by car or at the inns dock by boat or float plane. [1]"

aS'Apamea or Apameia (Ancient Greek: )  previously, Kibotos (Greek: ), h Kibtos or Cibotus  was an ancient city in Phrygia, Anatolia, founded by Antiochus I Soter (from whose mother, Apama, it received its name), near, but on lower ground than, Celaenae (Kelainai). It overlooks the Ghab valley and the site is now partly occupied by the city of Dinar (sometimes locally known also as Geyikler, "the gazelles," perhaps from a tradition of the Persian hunting-park, seen by Xenophon at Celaenae), which by 1911 was connected with zmir by railway; there are considerable remains, including a theater and a great number of important Graeco-Roman inscriptions. Strabo (p.577) says, that the town lies at the source (ekbolais) of the Marsyas, and the river flows through the middle of the city, having its origin in the city, and being carried down to the suburbs with a violent and precipitous current it joins the Maeander after the latter is joined by the Orgas (called the Catarrhactes by Herodotus, vii. 26). The original inhabitants were residents of Celaenae who were compelled by Antiochus I Soter to move farther down the river, where they founded the city of Apamea (Strabo, xii. 577). Antiochus the Great transplanted many Jews there. (Josephus, Ant. xii. 3,  4). It became a seat of Seleucid power, and a center of Graeco-Roman and Graeco-Hebrew civilization and commerce. There Antiochus the Great collected the army with which he met the Romans at Magnesia, and two years later the Treaty of Apamea between Rome and the Seleucid realm was signed there. After Antiochus\' departure for the East, Apamea lapsed to the Pergamene kingdom and thence to Rome in 133 BCE, but it was resold to Mithridates V of Pontus, who held it till 120 BCE. After the Mithridatic Wars it became and remained a great center for trade, largely carried on by resident Italians and by Jews. By order of Flaccus, a large amount of Jewish money  nearly 45 kilograms of gold  intended for the Temple in Jerusalem was confiscated in Apamea in the year 62 BCE (Cicero, Pro Flacco, ch. xxviii.). In 84 BCE Sulla made it the seat of a conventus, and it long claimed primacy among Phrygian cities. When Strabo wrote, Apamea was a place of great trade in the Roman province of Asia, next in importance to Ephesus. Its commerce was owing to its position on the great road to Cappadocia, and it was also the center of other roads. When Cicero was proconsul of Cilicia, 51 BCE, Apamea was within his jurisdiction (ad Fam. xiii. 67), but the dioecesis, or conventus, of Apamea was afterwards attached to Asia. Pliny the Elder enumerates six towns which belonged to the conventus of Apamea, and he observes that there were nine others of little note. The city minted its own coins in antiquity. The name Cibotus appears on some coins of Apamea, and it has been conjectured that it was so called from the wealth that was collected in this great emporium; for kibtos in Greek is a chest or coffer. Pliny (v. 29) says that it was first Celaenae, then Cibotus, and then Apamea; which cannot be quite correct, because Celaenae was a different place from Apamea, though near it. But there may have been a place on the site of Apamea, which was called Cibotus. The country about Apamea has been shaken by earthquakes, one of which is recorded as having happened in the time of Claudius (Tacit. Ann. xii. 58); and on this occasion the payment of taxes to the Romans was remitted for five years. Nicolaus of Damascus (Athen. p.332) records a violent earthquake at Apamea at a previous date, during the Mithridatic Wars: lakes appeared where none were before, and rivers and springs; and many which existed before disappeared. Strabo (p.579) speaks of this great catastrophe, and of other convulsions at an earlier period. Apamea continued to be a prosperous town under the Roman Empire. Its decline dates from the local disorganization of the empire in the 3rd century; and though a bishopric, it was not an important military or commercial center in Byzantine times. The Turks took it first in 1070, and from the 13th century onwards it was always in Muslim hands. For a long period it was one of the greatest cities of Asia Minor, commanding the Maeander road; but when the trade routes were diverted to Constantinople it rapidly declined, and its ruin was completed by an earthquake. Apamea is mentioned in the Talmud. The passages relating to witchcraft in Apamea (Ber. 62a) and to a dream in Apamea (Niddah, 30b) probably refer to the Apamea in Phrygia which was looked upon as a fabulously distant habitation. Similarly the much-discussed passage, Yeb. 115b, which treats of the journey of the exilarch Isaac, should also be interpreted to mean a journey from Corduene to Apamea in Phrygia; for if Apamea in Mesene were meant (Brll\'s Jahrb. x. 145) it is quite impossible that the Babylonians should have had any difficulty in identifying the body of such a distinguished personage. Apamea is enumerated by Hierocles among the episcopal cities of Pisidia, to which division it had been transferred. The bishops of Apamea sat in the Council of Nicaea (325). Arundell contends that Apamea, at an early period in the history of Christianity, had a church, and he confirms this opinion by the fact of there being the ruins of a Christian church there. It is probable enough that Christianity was early established here, and even that Saint Paul visited the place, for he went throughout Phrygia. But the mere circumstance of the remains of a church at Apamea proves nothing as to the time when Christianity was established there.

aS'"Where the Stars and Stripes and the Eagle Fly" is a title of a song written by Kenny Beard, Casey Beathard, and co-written and recorded by American country music singer Aaron Tippin. The song reached #2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart and also peaked at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100, marking Tippin\'s first entry into the Top 20. In addition, it was Tippin\'s last single to reach the Top Ten on the country charts. The song was released in the wake of the September 11 attacks. All proceeds from the single went to the Red Cross and its relief efforts for the families of the September 11 attacks. According to then label president, Larry Goodman, the single raised approximately $250,000.[1] Tippin had written the song with Kenny Beard and Casey Beathard for his 2000 album People Like Us, but it didn\'t make the cut. He says, "But now, I know exactly why it didn\'t. It had a bigger purpose." Two days after the September 11 attacks, he went to a Nashville studio to record the song.[2] The lyrics of the song offer a highly patriotic view of the United States. The music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy and it was filmed in September 2001. It was filmed in many different locations around New York City and shows citizens of New York and the rubble of the World Trade Center.

aS'A fuel dispenser is a machine at a filling station that is used to pump gasoline, diesel, CNG, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, LH2, ethanol fuel, biofuels like biodiesel, kerosene, or other types of fuel into vehicles. Fuel dispensers are also known as bowsers (in Australia),[1][not in citation given] petrol pumps (in Commonwealth countries), or gas pumps (in North America). The first gasoline pump was invented and sold by Sylvanus F. Bowser in Fort Wayne, Indiana on September 5, 1885.[2] This pump was not used for automobiles, as they had not been invented yet. It was instead used for some kerosene lamps and stoves. He later improved upon the pump by adding safety measures, and also by adding a hose to directly dispense fuel into automobiles. For a while, the term bowser was used to refer to a vertical gasoline pump. Although the term is not used anymore in the United States, it still is used sometimes in Australia and New Zealand. Many early gasoline pumps had a calibrated glass cylinder on top. The desired quantity of fuel was pumped up into the cylinder as indicated by the calibration. Then the pumping was stopped and the gasoline was let out into the customers tank by gravity. When metering pumps came into use, a small glass globe with a turbine inside replaced the measuring cylinder but assured the customer that gasoline really was flowing into the tank. A modern fuel dispenser is logically divided into two main parts an electronic "head" containing an embedded computer to control the action of the pump, drive the pump\'s displays, and communicate to an indoor sales system; and secondly, the mechanical section which in a self contained unit has an electric motor, pumping unit, meters, pulsers and valves to physically pump and control the fuel flow. In some cases the actual pump may be sealed and immersed inside the fuel tanks on a site, in which case it is known as a submersible pump. In general submersible solutions in Europe are installed in hotter countries, where suction pumps may have problems overcoming cavitation with warm fuels or when the distance from tank to pump is longer than a suction pump can manage. In modern pumps, the major variations are in the number of hoses or grades they can dispense, the physical shape, and the addition of extra devices such as pay at the pump devices and attendant "tag" readers. Flow rate is typically 40+ litres per minute and is higher for highspeed pumps serving trucks and other large vehicles. In the USA flow rate is limited to 10 gallons per minute (37.8 litres per minute) except "Any dispensing pump that is dedicated exclusively to heavy-duty vehicles, boats, or airplanes is exempt from this requirement.".[3] Historically, fuel dispensers had a very wide range of designs to solve the mechanical problems of mechanical pumping, reliable measurement, safety, and aesthetics. This has led to some popularity in collecting antique dispensers, especially in the USA.[4] Nozzles are attached to the pump via flexible hoses, allowing them to be placed into the vehicle\'s filling inlet. The hoses are robust to survive hardship conditions such as being driven over, and are often attached using heavy spring or coil arrangements to provide additional strength. A breakaway valve is also fitted to the hose to allow the nozzle and hose to break off and fuel flow to be stopped in the case a vehicle drives off with the nozzle still in the filler, although this is largely prevented today by the point-of-sale systems not allowing payment for fuel until the nozzle is returned to its petrol pump holder. The nozzles are usually color-coded to indicate which grade of fuel they dispense, however the color-coding differs between countries or even retailers. For example, a black handle in the UK indicates that the fuel dispensed is diesel. In the US, diesel pumps commonly use green hoses and green slipcovers over the nozzle. In some countries, pumps are able to mix two fuel products together before dispensing; this is referred to as blending or mixing. Typical usages are in a "mix" pump to add oil to petrol for two-stroke motorcycles, to produce an intermediate octane rating from separate high and low octane fuels, or to blend hydrogen and compressed natural gas (HCNG). One of the most important functions for the pump is to accurately measure the amount of fuel pumped. Flow measurement is almost always done by a 4 stroke piston meter connected to an electronic encoder. In older gas pumps, the meter is physically coupled to reeled meters (moving wheels with numbers on the side), while newer pumps turn the meters movement into electrical pulses using a rotary encoder. Gasoline is difficult to sell in a fair and consistent manner by volumetric units. It expands and contracts significantly as its temperature changes. A comparison of the coefficient of thermal expansion for gasoline and water indicates that gasoline changes at about 4.5 times the rate of water. In the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) specifies the accuracy of the measurements in Handbook 44. Table 3.30 specifies the accuracy at 0.3% meaning that a 10-US-gallon (37.9L; 8.3impgal) purchase could vary between 9.97US gal (37.7L; 8.3impgal) and 10.03US gal (38.0L; 8.4impgal) as to the actual amounts at the delivery temperature of the gasoline. The reference temperature for gasoline volume measurement is 60F or 15C. Ten gallons of gasoline at that temperature expands to about 10.15US gal (38.4L; 8.5impgal) at 85 F (29C) and contracts to about 9.83US gal (37.2L; 8.2impgal) at 30 F (1C). Each of the three volumes represents the same theoretical amount of energy. In one sense, ten gallons of gasoline purchased at 30F is about 3.2% more potential energy than ten gallons purchased at 85F. Most gasoline is stored in tanks underneath the filling station. Modern tanks are non-metallic and sealed to stop leaks. Some have double walls or other structures that provide inadvertent thermal insulation while pursuing the main goal of keeping gasoline out of the soil around the tank. The net result is that while the air temperature can easily vary between 30F and 85F, the gasoline in the insulated tank changes temperature much more slowly. Temperature compensation is common at the wholesale transaction level in the United States and most other countries. At the retail consumer level, Canada has converted to automatic temperature compensation and the United States has not. Where automatic temperature compensation is used, it can add up to 0.2% of uncertainty for mechanical-based compensation and 0.1% for electronic compensation, per Handbook 44. There are many fewer retail outlets for gasoline in the United States today than there were in 1980. Larger outlets sell gasoline rapidly, as much as 30,000US gal (110,000L; 25,000impgal) in a single day, even in remote places. Most finished product gasoline is delivered in 8 to 16 thousand gallon tank trucks so two deliveries in a 24 hour period is common. The belief is that the gasoline spends so little time in the retail sales system that its temperature at the point of sale does not vary significantly from winter to summer or by region. Canada has lower overall population densities and geographically larger gasoline distribution systems, compared to the United States. Temperature compensation at the retail level improves the fairness under those conditions. In some regions, regular required inspections are conducted to ensure the accuracy of fuel dispensers. For example, in the US state of Florida, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services conducts regular tests of calibration and fuel quality at individual dispensers. The department also conducts random undercover inspections using specially designed vehicles that can check the accuracy of the dispensers. The department issues correction required notices to stations with pumps found to be inaccurate.[5] Most other US states conduct similar inspections. In Canada, inspections are regularly conducted by the federal government department Measurement Canada. Inspection dates and test results are required, by law, to be displayed on a sticker on fuel dispensers for consumers to see. Under a recently proposed legislation by the House of Commons (C-14: Fairness at the Pumps Act), fines for a vendor with a modified fuel dispenser or poorly maintained dispenser would be up to $50,000. However, virtually all pumps that fail inspection in Canada do so for general calibration errors caused by use over time. Intentional modification for the purpose of deceiving consumers is extremely rare. The technology for communicating with gas pumps from a point of sale or other controller varies widely, involving a variety of hardware (RS-485, RS-422, current loop, and others) and proprietary software protocols. Traditionally these variations gave pump manufacturers a natural tie-in for their own point-of-sale systems, since only they understood the protocols.[6] An effort to standardize this in the 1990s resulted in the International Forecourt Standards Forum, which has had considerable success in Europe, but has less presence elsewhere. ("Forecourt" refers to the land area on which the fuel dispensers are located.) The shut-off valve was invented in Olean, New York in 1939 by Richard C. Corson. At a loading dock at the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Corson observed a worker filling a barrel with gasoline and thought it inefficient. The sound of a toilet flushing later gave him the idea for a "butterfly float." After developing a prototype with his assistant, Paul Wenke, Corson gave the suggestion to the company who later filed for a patent in his name. The initial intent of the device was to "allow a person to fill more than one barrel [of gasoline] at the same time."[7] This mechanism eventually developed into the modern gasoline pump cut-off valve.[8] Most modern pumps have an auto cut-off feature that stops the flow when the tank is full. This is done with a second tube, the sensing tube, that runs from just inside the mouth of the nozzle up to a Venturi pump in the pump handle. A mechanical valve in the pump handle detects this change of pressure and closes, preventing the flow of fuel.[9][10] A modern fuel pump will often contain control equipment for the vapor recovery system, which prevents gasoline vapor from escaping to the air. in the UK for example any new forecourt with a predicted throughput in excess of 500 m3 per month is required to have active vapour recovery installed, Petrol pump in Vienna, Austria.

Since fuel dispensers are the focal point of distributing fuel to the general public, and fuel is a hazardous substance, they are subject to stringent requirements regarding safety, accuracy and security. The exact details differ between countries and can depend to some extent on politics. For example in countries fighting corruption, such as Mexico,[11] gas pumps may be more stringently monitored by government officials, in order to detect attempts to defraud customers. Typically, individual pumps must be certified for operation after installation by a government weights and measures inspector, who tests that the pump displays the same amount that it dispenses.

aS'"And Then We Kiss" is a song by American recording artist Britney Spears. The song was written by Spears, Mark Taylor and Paul Barry, while produced by Taylor for In the Zone. This version featured an electronica vibe and prominent vocals by Spears. The song was remixed by Junkie XL for the remix album B in the Mix: The Remixes. The remix was released as the only single from the album in Australia and New Zealand,[1][2] as "And Then We Kiss", leading some to believe that it was the only version. The original version by Taylor leaked online in September 2011. The Junkie XL Remix is an euro-trance song with influences of techno and usage of dance-rock guitars, synthesizers and symphonic strings. The lyrics speak about a kiss and the different sensations that a woman experiences, including trembling, crying and moaning. Junkie XL explained that he wanted to make the song a 2006 version of Depeche Mode\'s "Enjoy the Silence". The Junkie XL Remix of "And Then We Kiss" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, with some noticing its potential to be a radio or club hit. The song failed to appear on any major charts. However, it peaked at number fifteen on the US Billboard Hot Dance Airplay. "And Then We Kiss" was written by Spears, Mark Taylor and Paul Barry, while produced by Taylor.[3][4] The song was recorded in the same sessions as "Breathe on Me", and was originally intended for In the Zone (2003). This version produced by Taylor features an electronica vibe reminiscent of Madonna\'s Ray of Light (1998), and contains a flamenco guitar with prominent lead vocals by Spears.[4] "And Then We Kiss" was set to be included on a bonus disc of Britney & Kevin: Chaotic (2005), but was left out for unknown reasons.[5] The song was remixed by Junkie XL and released on her remix album B in the Mix: The Remixes (2005). In the album credits, both Taylor and Junkie XL were listed as producers of the song. All instruments, including guitar, bass guitar, synths and drums, were played by Junkie XL. Audio mastering was done by Chaz Harper at Battery Mastering.[6] In September 2005, it was announced by Billboard that the remix would serve as the music for the ad campaign behind Spears\' fragrance, Fantasy.[7] The Junkie XL Remix was released as the only single from B in the Mix: The Remixes on October 31, 2005 in Australia and New Zealand, as "And Then We Kiss", leading some to believe that it was the only version.[1][2][4] The version of the song produced by Taylor remained unreleased for years, until a new mix of the song labeled as the original version leaked online on September 2, 2011. After suggestions that it may be a fake, Taylor confirmed its authenticity to Bradley Stern of Muumuse.com on September 5, 2011.[4] "And Then We Kiss" is four minutes and twenty-eight seconds long. It is an euro-trance song with influences of techno and usage of synthesizers.[8] The song blends dance-rock guitars and symphonic strings and closes with an orchestral overtone.[8][9] Its lyrics talk about a kiss and the different sensations that the protagonist experiences, including trembling, crying and moaning. At the beginning she sings the lines "Lying alone / touching my skin" which suggest that the whole song may actually be a fantasy.[8] Spears\'s vocals are much less prominent than on the original version.[4] In an interview with About.com, Junkie XL said he wanted to turn the song "into a 2006 version of Enjoy the Silence with really electronic chunky beats and nice melodic guitar lines. Besides the fact that [Britney]\'s singing on it, it could be a track off my album because it\'s the same vibe. I\'m really happy with the end result and so are they."[10] The Junkie XL Remix of "And Then We Kiss" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV noted "And Then We Kiss" had "the potential to be a radio or club hit  if Jive were actively promoting [B in the Mix]".[8] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said the remix "brings a simpatico blend of symphonic strings and dance-rock guitars" in its melody,[9] while Spence D. of IGN noted Junkie XL makes "the remix an understated swatch of atmospheric neo-goth poing and staccato rhythms."[11] A reviewer of Yahoo! Shopping considered the song "dreamy".[12] Kurt Kirton of About.com said that the remixes of "And Then We Kiss", "Toxic", "Touch of My Hand", "Someday (I Will Understand)" and "...Baby One More Time" "hold their own";[13] Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter, however, said "the many flaws in Spears\' reedy, cold and mechanical voice are brought to the forefront" in the remixes.[14] MTV writer Bradley Stern praised Junkie XL, writing, "the sublime remix found producer Junkie XL taking the (still) unreleased studio version of "And Then We Kiss" [...] and smoothing it over into one of Britney\'s most lush, mature musical moments of all time."[15] "And Then We Kiss" was not officially released as a single in the United States, therefore it was not eligible at the time to appear on Billboard\'s Hot 100. Even so, promotional vinyls were sent to radio stations,[16] who started to play the song unofficially and it managed to garner enough airplay to appear on the Hot Dance Airplay chart of Billboard in early 2006.[17] It debuted at number 25 on the chart issue dated February 25, 2006, reaching a new position of 23 on the following issue.[17] After five weeks on the chart, "And Then We Kiss" reached a peak of 15, on the chart issue dated March 25, 2006.[18] The song spent a total of eleven weeks on the chart,[19] making its last appearance on the week of May 6, 2006.[20] Despite being released on Australia and New Zealand, "And Then We Kiss" failed to appear on major charts of both countries.[21] Source:[6] '

aS'The Transformers (, Toransufom?) is a line of toys produced by the Japanese company Takara (now known as Takara Tomy) and American toy company Hasbro. The Transformers toyline was created from toy molds mostly produced by Japanese company Takara in the toylines Diaclone and Microman. Other toy molds from other companies such as Bandai were used as well. In 1984, Hasbro bought the distribution rights to the molds and rebranded them as the Transformers for distribution in North America. Hasbro would go on to buy the entire toy line from Takara, giving them sole ownership of the Transformers toy-line, branding rights, and copyrights, while in exchange, Takara was given the rights to produce the toys and the rights to distribute them in the Japanese market. The premise behind the Transformers toyline is that an individual toy\'s parts can be shifted about to change it from a vehicle, a device, or an animal, to a robot action figure and back again. The taglines "More Than Meets The Eye" and "Robots In Disguise" reflect this ability.[1] The Transformers toyline is typically divided into two main factions: the heroic Autobots and their opponents, the evil Decepticons (traditionally known in Japan as the Cybertrons and Destrons, respectively, although more recent releases often use the English terms). Transformers toys are sold at a number of price points, and various Transformers series utilize unique play features. There have also been a number of spin-offs based on the toys including a Marvel comic book series, an animated television series program presented by Claster Television, Inc., a television production company that Hasbro organized for this and similar purposes, that began transmissions in 1984 (Transformers series) and a feature-length movie, The Transformers: The Movie. The original series program was followed by a number of spin-offs with varying levels of popularity. A live-action film series, directed by Michael Bay under the sponsorship of Steven Spielberg has had three films with more planned. The following Transformers toy series were released in the United States: Many Transformers come with tech specs (short for technical specifications) printed on the back of the box that they are sold in. The owner of the new Transformer is encouraged to cut out the tech specs and save it. This card has information on the Transformer, and will usually include the character\'s name, picture, indication of allegiance (Autobot, Decepticon or other), function, a quote, a description of the character, and numerical values of the character\'s various attributes. Although only the numbers can be truly deemed "technical specifications", the entire card is usually referred to as the Transformer\'s tech specs. Each specification is rated by a value from 1 to 10, 1 being the lowest, and 10 being the highest. Micromaster teams have teamwork ratings instead of ranks. Unlike the other ratings, teamwork seems to be split along faction lines, with Autobots typically holding higher teamwork ratings than Decepticons. A second unique spec value, Cooperation, replaced the Firepower rating used on individuals\' cards. The traditional order (as above) was also abandoned for the Micromaster team specifications. The values started becoming inconsistent and skewed in Generation 2 and Beast Wars, when Hasbro apparently thought no child will ever want a toy that is described as anything less than perfect. Thus it became rarer and rarer to see any low numbers. Most characters\' numbers hardly ever dipped below 8, the Go-Bot version of Optimus Prime was the first character to have all values at 10, a trend that would repeat for most "leader" characters. When even more powerful versions of the Optimus Primal toy (such as Optimal Optimus) were introduced, Hasbro even invented a "10+" rating in an attempt to keep increasing the power levels. With the Transformers: Cybertron line a few characters even got "Unknown" and "Infinity" ratings. The specifications portion of the tech specs which came with earlier G1 Transformers were obfuscated with interference patterns which made them difficult to read without a decoder which was included in the box for each Transformer. The decoder consisted of simple red plastic which rendered the interference patterns invisible. Related to tech specs were Marvel\'s Transformer Universe comics, where the entry for each Transformer contained an expanded bio based on the one printed on the tech specs. However, numerical tech specs were not included. The first Transformers toys were created from two different transforming robot toylines from Takara, the Diaclone and Micro Change (Microman) series. Hasbro acquired the rights to sell them in the United States but, instead of selling them under their original names, they were rebranded as "The Transformers". The first two years consisted primarily of reusing the Diaclone/Micro Change molds. Some of the models from the Diaclone line still have the pilot\'s seat in their design. The earliest toys had some parts made of die-cast metal, which were eventually phased out. The line was released as "The Transformers" in the USA, Canada and the UK in 1984 but Takara was still marketing Diaclone at least during 1984. Hence in Japan "The Transformers" did not debut under that brand till 1985, when the line was also rolled out to the majority of the rest of the world between Takara and Hasbro. Hasbro Europe still will not accept, however, that the range was released in the UK in 1984[citation needed], not even with evidence such as Argos 1984 catalogues containing the range, the UK comic launching in September 1984 or even the 1984 Transformers product catalogue produced by "Hasbro Industries (UK) Ltd, Wokingham". It is thought that Hasbro Europe as it now stands did not come into existence till 1985, hence no records of Transformers sales in 1984.[citation needed] UK Transformers toys were sold in boxes identical to those of their American counterparts until around 1998/9 when the range started to have UK exclusives. The 1984 and 1985 toy lines contained several figures of note. Megatron, the Decepticon leader, originally transformed into a realistic Walther P-38 pistol with stock and barrel extensions and scope. The Megatron toy was delayed till 1985 for release in the UK. The Constructicons were the first "gestalt" team in the Transformers line, but were different from most subsequent gestalt teams in that they consisted of six members instead of five. The Autobot Jetfire was repainted from a Macross toy, specifically the VF-1 Valkyrie, and the character was renamed Skyfire in the animated television series program for copyright reasons. In 1986 the Transformers animated movie had been released, and during the run of the movie, through a pamphlet that came with certain figures, you could order certain Transformers through the mail, such as Optimus Prime among other toys. The toys came in a standard brown mailer box, with items, booklet, and a limited Edition Movie certificate and sticker. The 1986 line featured another significant change in that many, if not the majority, of the toys were conceived as futuristic vehicles and bore little resemblance to present-day machinery. This was due to changes in the movie and television series, which leaped ahead twenty years to the year 2005. Many have speculated that this change might have been what signaled the beginning of the end for the Transformers, as part of the novelty of the first lines was the realistic vehicles that turned into robots. For the 1987 and 1988 lines, Hasbro introduced even more radical ideas through new sub-groups. The Headmasters and Targetmasters came with partners who transformed into the figure\'s head or weapon, respectively. Powermasters, including the new version of fan favorite Optimus Prime, came with partners that transformed into engines. Each line would see various permutations over the two-year span, including smaller Headmasters, Double Targetmasters, and a Powermaster with two engines. The most controversial line of this period was the Pretenders. Pretenders consisted of a Transformer contained inside an action figure shell who could "pretend" to be either a human or a monster. Complaints with this line were numerous, including the lack of articulation of the figures (the shells could only move their arms), the simple transformation of the robots within, and their increasing lack of resemblance to any sort of modern recognizable vehicle. Still, despite the complaints, the Pretender line continued through all but the final year of Generation One, with variations such as Beast Pretenders, Monster Pretenders, Classic Pretenders, Mega Pretenders and Ultra Pretenders, each with variations on the theme or increasing levels of complexity. Also during this time, Micromasters were introduced, and would become one of the last sub-groups of Generation One. Micromasters were tiny Transformers created to compete with the Micro Machines, a hugely popular toy line of the time. While many of the figures had simple transformations and little detail due to their small size, the line eventually expanded to feature Micromaster Transports and Bases, in which Micromasters came with larger vehicles or bases that transformed. In 1989, the entire line became limited to Pretenders and Micromasters. For the first time, the Transformers received a new design for their title logo. But many also regarded this as a time of a dearth in creativity and the lowest point in the toyline\'s history. The year 1990 saw the last American burst with the release of more Micromaster characters and the introduction of the Action Masters, non-transforming action figures who came with Transforming companions. Larger Action Master sets came with transforming vehicles and bases. The Action Master line was criticized for its perceived desperation for a gimmick, although it had a few defenders. The line predictably faded and would be the last Transformers output in the US until 1992. While Transformers ended poorly for the US market, the same can not be said for the UK, Canada, and Japan markets as they went on to produce their own continuing series between 1991 to 1993, despite the UK market in particular missing a substantial amount of figures prominent in the comics and animated series throughout the line\'s run. Each country produced their own continuity. The UK and Canada continued with new Action Master figures and introduced the Turbo Masters and Predators. Japan continued with the Micromasters concept. The 1992 and 1993 European and Canadian releases make up what is often called "Generation 1.5", much to the annoyance of many UK fans. These toys are similar in design to the Generation 2 Transformers, having lightpipe eyes, and pastel colors. The 1993 European figures used the G2 faction symbols which Hasbro UK designed because their licence on the G1 symbols had expired. The 1993 figures were repackaged for European G2 release in 1994, and three subgroup molds got used in the US G2 line. The term Generation 1 is a retronym; the series was simply known as "Transformers" until the release of the Generation 2 series. However, the term has become semi-official, as both Hasbro and Takara have referred to this era as "Generation 1". New characters are still occasionally added to the line, primarily by E-hobby. (Examples: Sunstorm, Hauler, Detritus, and the like.) Large-scale production of new characters in this line ended with the onset of Generation 2. Transformers fans often are very upheld with the G1 community. This has led to controversy among fans who consider G1 to be the only "pure" form of Transformers. The line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line. In late 1993, Hasbro relaunched the Transformers franchise with the Generation 2 line, with production again largely being done by Takara. The subgroups concept was done away with for the first year, but there were no new molds or characters. Generation 2 re-used the molds for many of the characters from the 1984 and 1985 line, but with mostly different color schemes and finishes, as well as different weapons and accessories. Megatron\'s figure was released later on. As noted previously, Megatron\'s original alternate mode, or "transformation identity", was a handgun with attachments, but in Generation Two, this was changed to a tank due to safety and security concerns. Most of the 1994 figures were re-releases or recolors of European G1 releases. Unfortunately for both Takara and Hasbro, the Generation Two series of Transformers sold poorly, and Hasbro abandoned it after two years. There were toys planned that never saw release. Most of these were G1 combiner team recolors or recolors of recent figures. Four unreleased molds were released in the Machine Wars line, and four more resurfaced in the Robots In Disguise series. The line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line. With the failure of the Generation 2 series, Hasbro and Takara decided the franchise needed an overhaul. They went in a new direction and a new beginning. While there had been Transformers that change into robotic animals, the premise of the new line was that all figures would transform into animals with realistic appearances. The Beast Wars toyline was launched in the autumn of 1995, and Mainframe Entertainment produced a computer-generated imagery, or CGI, animated series program to tie in with the new toyline. A fresh idea coupled with a TV series program with strong stories assured this series the success Hasbro and Takara needed, as this series was a giant hit in international markets as well as in Takara\'s home market, Japan. Hasbro\'s original plan for the Beast Wars was to have Optimus Prime, renamed Optimus Primal, and Megatron be reformatted versions of their 1980s selves. This was shown in the toys\'s Tech Specs, and in the comic packaged with the basic Optimus Primal/Megatron two-pack. Hasbro also wanted the "Mutant Heads" found on all of the deluxe sized first year toys as battle helmets, but Mainframe scrapped the idea as it would have required three animation models for each character instead of two. Another designed feature for the 1995/1996 toys was carried over from Generation 2, transparent "light pipe" eyes. However, most toys had those parts cast in opaque plastic. The Beast Wars line was also the first appearance of "flip changer" Basics, where flipping a part of the animal mode (usually the head or tail) would transform the entire toy, and moving the part back would transform the toy back to beast mode. Like other features, this was only used in the 1995/1996 Basics and their repaints. Beast Wars: Transformers had to be renamed in some countries, particularly Canada, because of concern over the word "war" in the title. So, in some countries, it was released under the title Beasties. Long-time Transformers fans noticed the prominence of the words "Beast Wars" over "Transformers", the latter appearing in small type under the former. The Transformers\'s fan base splintered into two groups as a direct result, with the one enjoying Beast Wars for what it was and the other refusing to accept it as official canon in the Transformers mythology. The success of Beast Wars and the change in storyline resulted in its second phase: Beast Machines. Like Beast Wars, the name Transformers was used only as a secondary title. While still a success, the storyline and direction borne by Beast Machines was questioned and criticized by the most ardent fans who knew the previous history of the Transformers. Also, there was a clamor for a return to the original idea of the Transformers, that of their being protean robots with nearly humanlike artificial intelligences who transformed into vehicles or devices. The line was later commemorated as sub-series of the Transformers: Titanium and Transformers: Universe lines. While Beast Machines was still running in Canada, Japan\'s Takara made a bid to return to the familiar vehicle-transforming robots concept. In 2000, Car Robots was released. This line was brought by Hasbro to America as the Robots In Disguise series, and featured the Autobots facing off against the Predacons. This series is usually regarded by most as filler while Hasbro contemplated the next direction for Transformers. However most fans of Transformers recognise that most if not all of the toys released from this line were of excellent quality (with the Optimus Prime and Ultra Magnus figures gaining considerable praise), combining the ball-joint articulation with detailed, well painted alternate modes. Once again Optimus Prime and Megatron were re-engineered, with Prime now a fire truck and Megatron a six changer, whose modes included a dragon, bat, jet, land-craft and a giant hand. Another G1 character to get a new toy for this line was Ultra Magnus, who could combine with Optimus Prime to form Omega Prime. Other combiners were created for the series too, such as Landfill and Rail Racer. Bruticus, a combiner from G1 was also recoloured and introduced into the series, with a coinciding toy re-release. The Combaticons that formed Bruticus were the first of the Decepticons to be introduced into the show along with Scourge, who as a toy was a black repaint of G2 Laser Prime. These were not the only toys to be re-released for this series, with many from past lines being repainted and packaged in RID boxes. Robots In Disguise was responsible for introducing a lot of concepts that would be re-used often in the next incarnations of Transformers. Also of note, Megatron\'s toy was repainted and re-released (retooled to allow 4 new altmodes) under the name Galvatron, beginning a tradition of repaints that would follow through with Armada and subsequent toy lines. The line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line. In 2003, Transformers: Armada launched a pivotal new era in the toy line. After several lines of toys produced by one company or the other, Hasbro and Takara united to produce what was purported to be a single, identical line of Transformers for release worldwide. In tandem with this new endeavor, Armada signaled a new continuity in its accompanying animated series and a new focus in both the show and the toys on Mini-Cons, a new faction of Transformers. The Mini-Cons were much smaller robots (not much larger than humans) who were neutral in the Autobot/Decepticon fight, but due to their incredible power and abilities, were sought by both factions. The lowest priced toys in the Armada line were three-packs of Mini-Cons. Each larger price point consisted of an Autobot or Decepticon who came with a Mini-Con partner. Mini-Cons could be used to unlock a variety of features on each larger robot, such as firing weapons, electronic lights and sounds, or alternate modes. Some three-pack Mini-Cons combined into other forms or had additional features. According to the storyline, Mini-Cons also enhanced the power of other Transformers, giving incentive to collect as many of them as possible. Other items of note in the Armada line: The line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line. A catch-all line initially filled with mostly redecos and repackages of older toys. This line was revitalized in 2008 with new molds and the introduction of various sub-series from previous popular Transformers lines like Classics. After the successful Armada toy line, Hasbro/Takara introduced Transformers: Energon. The accompanying television series program was a direct continuation of the events of Transformers: Armada and featured many of the same characters in new forms. This was reflected in the toy line, as characters such as Hot Shot, Jetfire, Optimus Prime and Megatron were all released with entirely new molds. Transformers: Energon introduced several new concepts to the toy line. Two new sub-groups, the Omnicons and Terrorcons, joined the fray, representing smaller factions of the Autobots and Decepticons respectively. The smaller toys in these sub-groups came with Energon weapons that could be used by the larger Autobots and Decepticons, along with Energon chips that could be fastened to the larger figures to enhance their power. Energon weapons and chips came in a variety of colors of translucent plastic. Many Autobot figures in the line were able to combine with a partner to form a larger robot through the "Powerlinx" process. The Decepticons were designed instead with alternative "attack modes". While no longer the focus of the line, there were several Mini-Con releases in Energon as well. Other items of note in the Energon line: Transformers: Cybertron, named Galaxy Force in Japan, was a follow-up to the successful Armada and Energon lines. The companion anime series program was not originally conceived or produced as a continuation of the Armada/Energon storyline, and it was only later that it was retconned to be a continuation. Thus, several inconsistencies exist. Once again, a new feature was introduced for the lineCyber Keys, which activated special functions on the figures in a manner similar to the Mini-Cons in Armada. Each figure came with a Cyber Key regardless of size, but there were several Cyber Keys crucial to the plot of the anime series which only came with certain figures. Again, many of the same characters were included but with entirely new figures from new molds. Also of note in the Cybertron line: The line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line. (translated from the Japanese Wikipedia article) The Transformers: Kiss Players was a Japan-only line of Transformers toys, manga, and audio dramas released in 2006. Kiss Players is set in an alternate Transformers universe where the Transformers are powered by the kisses of young girls. The toys themselves come packaged with small, scale figurines of the girls who power them. The toyline was openly admitted to be aimed at a specific part of the market  adults, rather than children. The comic that accompanied the Kiss Players was an unashamed reflection of this, with several images which were considered by some to be very sexually themed. Kiss Players continued the theme of the metaphysical power potential of human beings empowering Transformers. Previous examples were the Japanese series programs Masterforce and Car Robots.[2] Transfomers: Classics was a filler line for Hasbro, to fill the gap between the end of Cybertron and the 2007 Movie line. It mostly consisted of "Classic" Generation One characters, with contemporary re-designs and updated alternate modes. The line was later commemorated as a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line, where it had the nickname of "Classics 2.0". The live-action Transformers movie was slated to premiere in the U.S. on July 3, 2007, and was a joint collaboration among DreamWorks SKG, Paramount Pictures and Hasbro, Inc. Paramount Pictures was slated to release the film in the United States, as it had by now made DreamWorks Pictures one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, and was also to be responsible for the international release of the film through United International Pictures, its joint venture with Universal Studios. The feature was directed by Michael Bay from a screenplay written by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci. It was a new story, set apart from the previous incarnations of the cartoon(s) and comic(s). A new origin and characters were introduced. Steven Spielberg, who with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen had established DreamWorks SKG, was the main executive producer of the film, with Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Tom DeSanto and Don Murphy serving as co-executive producers. In practice, this meant that they were the primary financial sponsors of the film. Shia LaBeouf portrays the lead human character, Sam Witwicky, in the film with Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and Megan Fox in supporting roles. Peter Cullen reprises his role as the voice of Optimus Prime. Megatron\'s voice is provided by Hugo Weaving. It was expected that the release of a new movie would involve the production and release of associated toys from Takara and Hasbro. Images surfaced, on-line, of some toy prototypes, notably Starscream and a new Decepticon who was to be named Blackout, along with packaged samples of movie preview "Protoform" Optimus Prime and Starscream toys. Similarly, fans found preliminary artwork of multiple characters, although it was not known at the time how close these were to the final designs. The designs were significantly different from those of the Generation 1 characters with the same names. Reactions varied widely: some fans objected strongly to the designs, occasionally going so far as to threaten a boycott if the designs were not changed to be more traditional, while others liked them. The issue became a divisive one, as detractors accused supporters of lacking respect for the franchise\'s history, while supporters accused detractors of being "stuck in the past", and not accepting change. In the "Transformers" film, the robots had more of an alien feel to them to fit the theme of an alien invasion. The robots (stated by Optimus Prime) in the film are actual sentient organisms and not just giant, mindless, and mechanical machines. The robots can also speak their own alien language sounding like what seems to be based on different pitches and frequencies. Alongside that, they gave them more alien features that probably wasn\'t mentioned in the comics or T.V. series such as a highly advanced exoskeleton, force field, and a special "alien meteoroid" mode which they transform into individually and arrive on earth in. The exoskeleton is a "self-regenerating metal" in which the aliens are composed of (stated in the film) that is the equivalent of living skin that heals itself. Even though the transformers were heavily modified for the film for a more alien "feel", they still kept some key features from the G1 look to stay true to the character\'s origins. Examples: Optimus\' faceplate and primary colors, and Megatron\'s arm cannon. Megatron\'s head also resembles a helmet-like shape. Also, as a new feature, most figures include advanced "automorph technology", which is designed to create quicker and easier conversion, which means moving one part of the vehicle or robot causes other parts to move, creating a final shift to battle mode; this was successful because the transformation was more complex in the movie line than in any other Transformers toyline. The Transformers Animated series broadcasted internationally in 2008 except in Japan, where it aired in 2010. This new series uses a very different art-style from the previous series. The Autobots and Decepticons, while fighting in space for possession of the Allspark, crash-landed onto a futuristic Earth and resume their battle after laying dormant for years. In addition to the Decepticons, the Autobots have to face the human villains as well. Classic characters such as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Prowl, Starscream, Megatron, Jazz and Ultra Magnus appear in this series. Originally, Transformers: Animated was to be called "Transformers: Heroes", but its name was changed to avoid confusion with the Transformers live-action film. The line was released alongside a sub-series of the Transformers: Universe line for its Legends size figures. This line features robot versions of various Star Wars characters. Confirmed figures are Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Commander Cody and Jango Fett. Darth Vader turns into his custom Tie Fighter while Luke Skywalker turns into an X-Wing. Jango Fett and Boba Fett become Slave I, and Commander Cody turns into a Turbo Tank. There is combiner of Millennium Falcon of two characters, Han Solo and Chewbacca and Primus/Unicron-like Death Star that transforms into a giant Darth Vader. There are more Star Wars characters into Transformers like General Grievous and Obi-Wan Kenobi. This line was later revived and merged into the Transformers: Crossovers toyline, many more Transformers included characters from Star Wars: The Clone Wars like Ahsoka Tano who transforms into her Jedi starfighter, and Captain Rex who transforms into an AT-TE.[3] This is a new line which features robot versions of various Marvel Comics superheroes (and later more of the Star Wars Transformers figures once it merged with this line). Confirmed figures are Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, Venom and Hulk. Hulk turns into a tank while Iron Man turns into a jet. Spider-Man becomes a helicopter, Wolverine turns into a 4WD, Venom turns into a turbocharged retro car. They are not to be confused with the Marvel Megamorphs toy line, which also featured transformable mecha piloted by the superheroes. Eventually, the Star Wars Transformers figure joined the line with reissues of previous figures, as well as all new molds. A Japanese exclusive, This is a new line of Transformers toys shaped from Disney characters that were first introduced in 2009. Originally revealed in the November 2008 issue of Figure Oh! Magazine in Japan, it was a collaboration project between Takara Tomy and the Walt Disney Company. The first line of the toy series is the Mickey Mouse Transformer which was modeled after Optimus Prime with the same colors as its Transformer counterpart and can transform into a cartoonish trailer truck like the original version. The toy was released on February 26, 2009 following with the Black and White Version a month later on March 26, 2009. A figure of Donald Duck based on both Bumblebee and Herbie the Love Bug, and a second repaint of the Mickey Mouse trailer in Halloween colors, are also planned for release. In 2010, a Transformer version of Buzz Lightyear was released to celebrate the release of Toy Story 3. This figure transforms into his spaceship (similar to the box packaging of the original Buzz Lightyear toy), with his head transforming into a miniature Buzz Lightyear pilot figure. Ralston marketed many cereals based on cartoons in the 80s and 90s. One of these was Transformers. The Transformers Chocolate Flavored Cereal was a chocolate-flavored concoction, not unlike Cocoa Puffs, manufactured by the Ralston Corporation. However, the cereal was sold only in some parts of the United States and was short lived. The cereal box had Optimus Prime on its cover. The box claims the cereal had "more taste than meets the eye" and also had the ability to "transform ordinary milk into chocolate flavored milk". There also was a mail-away offer for a Jazz toy. The few boxes that still exist are collectables,[4] (one of which went for $349 on eBay). The official international Transformers convention is BotCon, but other fan events include Auto Assembly and TransForce in the UK and past Transformers only events have included BotCon Japan, BotCon Europe and "OTFCC". The first larger Transformers convention in the Nordic countries is called "The NTFA Mini-Con", with official support from Hasbro Nordic, and was held by members of the NTFA - The Nordic TransFans Association, for the first time on November 34, 2007. The second NTFA convention with official support from Hasbro Nordic, now renamed "NordCon" (to avoid copyright problems with the name "Mini-Con") was held in Aalborg, Denmark from 19 June to 20 June 2010. It featured Simon Furman as a guest of honour. In 2011, NordCon and Auto Assembly joined forces to create a new convention called Auto Assembly Europe, which first took place in Uppsala, Sweden, in November 2011.[5][6] A Transformers Hall of Fame was created in 2010. Initial inaugurees presented at Botcon 2010 ceremonies included Bob Budiansky, Peter Cullen, Hideaki Yoke, no Kjin, and the characters Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Starscream, and Dinobot.[7][8][9] In 1986, Ocean Software Ltd. released a video game based on the Transformers. It was available for ZX Spectrum[10] and Commodore 64.[11] It was rated slightly above average in the reviews. In 1986 Activision also released a Transformers game for the Commodore 64.[12] Takara released a Famicom game named Transformers: Convoy no Nazo, which put the player in control of Ultra Magnus. The game was poorly received in Japan and was not released overseas. Another game was released for the Sony PlayStation 2 by Atari; simply titled as Transformers, it was based on The Transformers: Armada. The game\'s reception was mixed, particularly due to the popularity of a PS2 Transformers game released at the same time for a Japanese-exclusive market, though the Armada game was of a higher quality and featured much better gameplay. The game not released in America was based on the Generation 1 storylines. Hasbro sold the digital gaming rights various properties, including My Little Pony, Magic: The Gathering, Tonka, Playskool, and The Transformers, to Infogrames for 100 million dollars in American money in 2000, buying back the rights for 65 million in American money in June 2005.[13] Activision and Traveller\'s Tales, creators of the Lego Star Wars games, released Transformers: The Game in 2007 to tie in with the live-action feature film for the Sony PlayStation 3, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo DS, PC, Sony PlayStation Portable, and PlayStation 2. The player was able to play as both the Autobots and the Decepticons, pick up and throw objects, and transform at any time. The steering in vehicle mode was compared to that of the Grand Theft Auto games and had a free-roaming environment. A movie tie-in game for the sequel to the 2009 movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was released along with the movie on June 24, 2009. It has similar gameplay and features as Transformers: the Game, and has online multiplayer gaming for the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. Transformers: War For Cybertron was released in June 2010 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Nintendo DS. The game takes on Cybertron during the Great War between the Autobots, led first by Zeta Prime and then Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons, led by Megatron. Transformers: Cybertron Adventures was released alongside War For Cybertron for the Wii and utilizes the same characters and setting. A movie tie-in game for the sequel to the 2011 movie "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" was released a few weeks prior to the movie on June 14, 2011. (the movie is set to be first screened on July 1, 2011) It has similar gameplay and features as that of the "War For Cybertron" game as it\'s made by the same developers, High Moon Studios. The game takes place on Earth just two years after the events of "Revenge of the Fallen" and will focus on both factions in their \'final battle\'. Adjustments to the previous concept of the game had been made, including the online multiplayer where you can customize iconic characters appearance, abilities and weapons rather than the unknown transformers that were in the game prior to this one by High Moon Studios where you could only customize the appearance, abilities and choose the weapons. A sequel to War for Cybertron titled, Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, was released in 2012.'

aS'Zinc finger protein ZFPM2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ZFPM2 gene.[1][2][3] The zinc finger protein encoded by this gene is a widely expressed member of the FOG family of transcription factors. The family members modulate the activity of GATA family proteins, which are important regulators of hematopoiesis and cardiogenesis in mammals. It has been demonstrated that the protein can both activate and down-regulate expression of GATA-target genes, suggesting different modulation in different promoter contexts. A related mRNA suggests an alternatively spliced product but this information is not yet fully supported by the sequence.[3] ZFPM2 has been shown to interact with GATA4,[4] GATA1[5] and CTBP2.[2]'

aS'Hazen is an unincorporated community in Churchill County, Nevada, United States, about 12 miles (19km) southeast of Fernley and 16 miles (26km) northwest of Fallon, on U.S. Route 50.[1] Hazen was founded in 1903 as a station on the Southern Pacific Railroad.[2] Some sources say the town was first settled in 1869, but it doesn\'t appear on maps until 1903.[2][3] The community was named for William Babcock Hazen, an aide to William Tecumseh Sherman.[3] At one time Hazen had a post office, which was established in 1904.[2][4] Hazen\'s early economy was driven by railroad workers and canal and dam builders, who patronized the town\'s saloons and brothels.[2] The Hazen Store is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).[2] It "almost defies architectural description" according to the NRHP nomination form.[2] Vulcan Power Company started a permitting process to drill exploratory geothermal energy wells on land leases near Hazen. The project involves a bypass road across Bureau of Reclamation property.[5][6] The Hawthorne Army Depot is connected to the Union Pacific rail network by a 120-mile (190km) single rail line beginning in Hazen.[7] Coordinates: 393355N 1190247W / 39.565192N 119.046273W / 39.565192; -119.046273'

aS'"Pictures of Lily" is a single by the British rock band The Who, written by guitarist and primary songwriter Pete Townshend. It was released in 1967 as a single, and made the top five in the UK, but failed to break into the top 50 in the United States. In the beginning of the song, the singer laments his insomnia. When his father gives him the pictures of the song\'s eponymous Lily, he feels better, and is able to sleep. Soon, he feels desire for Lily as a person instead of a photo, and asks his father for an introduction. His father informs him however that "Lily" has, in fact, been dead since 1929. Initially, the singer laments, but before long turns back to his fantasy. According to Pete Townshend in the 2006 book "Lyrics" by Rikky Rooksby, "the idea was inspired by a picture my girlfriend had on her wall of an old Vaudeville star - Lily Bayliss [sic]. It was an old 1920s postcard and someone had written on it \'Here\'s another picture of Lily - hope you haven\'t got this one.\' It made me think that everyone has a pin-up period." Lillie Langtry, the music hall star, died in 1929, the year in the song. Townshend\'s statement is unlikely to refer to Lilian Baylis, the theatre manager, who died in 1937.[1] Mark Wilkerson quotes Townshend as writing that the song is "Merely a ditty about masturbation and the importance of it to a young man."[2] However, the song does not mention masturbation explicitly. This song was first played live in 1966, and they continued to play through whilst touring until 1968. It returned to make a one-off appearance at a show in Passaic, New Jersey on 11 September 1979, where singer Daltrey forgot the lyrics and they went straight to Free\'s "All Right Now", which the band performed on rare occasions in the 1970s. Daltrey performed this four times in his 1985 solo tour. The Who returned it to their set list, however, and most recently performed it in 1989. Though Daltrey stated in 2008 the song had been taken off their set list, he is currently performing it on his Use It Or Lose It solo tour. During the period that the song was recorded, in 1967, Kit Lambert, the band\'s first "real" manager, according to Townshend, mixed the song. He filmed the band recording the song, showing the four bandmates performing, with Keith Moon being recruited for the high notes in the song (even though Pete Townshend can be heard telling Keith he "keeps jumping on John\'s part", however, other live video footage shows John Entwistle, the band\'s bassist harmonizing and playing the trumpet. Daltrey has said the French horn solo was an attempt to emulate a World War I klaxon warning siren, as the Lily girl was a World War I-era pinup.'

aS'Be Happy Koi no Yajirobee (BE HAPPY ?, "Be Happy (Balance Toy of Love)") is the 8th and final single by the Hello! Project girl group Tanpopo, and the first and only release by the group\'s "third generation" (Rika Ishikawa, Ayumi Shibata, Asami Konno, and Risa Niigaki). It was released on September 26, 2002 with the catalog number EPCE-5178. The first pressing came with a special trading card.[1] The single peaked at #5 on the weekly Oricon charts, charting for 6 weeks.[2] The single has a "crisp feel", with a touch of hip hop and R&B.[3] This single sold 40,070 copies in its first week and 60,450 copies all together, making it the group\'s lowest-selling single.[4] It was not, however, their worst-charting single, as it cracked Oricon\'s top five, which some "first generation" singles had failed to do. The PV for the song was featured on Tanpopo Single V Clips 1, released in June 2004.[5] All songs written and composed by Tsunku. '

aS"Tatyana Mikhailovna Lioznova (Russian:   ; 20 July 1924 29 September 2011) was a Soviet film director best known for her TV series Seventeen Moments of Spring (1973). All of Lioznova's features - from Three Poplars at Plyushchikha Street (1967), a cult film of the 1960s, to her last movie, The Carnival (1981), - are distinguished by open narratives, psychologically penetrating close-ups, and poignant musical scores. The subtle and touching drama Three Poplars at Plyuschikha Street (1967) sprouted from Aleksandra Pakhmutovas song Tenderness. The starry duet of Tatiana Doronina and Oleg Yefremov is a masterpiece of acting. This story of a nearly sprung love of a taxi driver and a married peasant woman won the hearts of Russian viewers, just like Casablanca gained the love of Americans. Known as a tireless perfectionist, filming just half a dozen features, this didn't prevent her becoming People's Artist of the USSR in 1984. She worked at the Gorky Film Studio. Lioznova devoted many efforts and much time to teaching. Among the students of Professor Lioznova there are a lot of cinematographers well-known today. Lioznova was Jewish and was a member of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public from 1983 to the closing of Commitee in 1994.[1]"

aS'Moses Lake is a city in Grant County, Washington, United States. The population was 20,366 as of the 2010 census. Moses Lake is the largest city in Grant County. Moses Lake, on which the city lies, is made up of three main arms over 18 miles (29km) long and up to one mile (1.6km) wide. It is the largest natural body of fresh water in Grant County and has over 120 miles (190km) of shoreline covering 6,500 acres (2,600ha). Before it was dammed in the early 1900s and then incorporated into the Columbia Basin Project, Moses Lake was a smaller, salty, shallow lake. One of its early names was "Salt Lake".[6] To the south of the town is the Potholes Wildlife reservation that has a number of seep lakes and vast amounts of migratory birds and other fauna natural to the area. Before the construction of Grand Coulee Dam on the Columbia River in 1941 and Larson Air Base in 1942 the area was largely barren. Native Americans knew the area as Houaph, which meant willow. Chief Moses was leader of the Sinkiuse tribe from 1859 to 1899, and was forced to negotiate with white settlers who began to settle in the area in the 1880s. Under pressure from the government, Chief Moses traded the Columbia Basin land for a reservation that stretched from Lake Chelan north to the Canadian border. The government later traded again for what is now the Colville Indian Reservation. The new settlers named the lake in honor of the chief. The city was originally named Neppel, after a town in Germany where one of the original settlers had lived.The first settlers established fisheries and farms  some of the first exported items were carp, jackrabbits and fruit  but irrigation attempts failed and settlers left at about the same rate as they came. When the town was incorporated and renamed Moses Lake in 1938, the population was estimated at 301 people. Arrival of the air base in 1942 and irrigation water pumped from Grand Coulee Dam in 1955 offered newcomers a reason and a way to settle in an area that previously had little to offer other than good fishing and a place to water sheep and cattle. Moses Lake was quickly transformed into a hub for a vast region where transportation, agriculture and recreation came together. The air base was built to train World War II pilots to fly the P-38 Lightning and B-17 Flying Fortress, two planes that were essential to the war effort. The base was closed after the war ended, but reopened in 1948 as a U.S. Air Force base and test area for Boeings B-47 Stratojet and B-50 Superfortress. The B-47 tests led to development of modern commercial jetliners still used today. Fighter jets were stationed there to protect Grand Coulee Dam to the north and the Hanford site to the south. Boeing still uses the airport as a test and evaluation facility for its aircraft. Japan Airlines used the airport as a training area from November 1968 until March 2009. The old air base is now owned by the Port of Moses Lake and is home to Grant County International Airport, Big Bend Community College and several businesses. Farmers, meanwhile, had developed new methods to irrigate water from the lake and from the Columbia River and began planting expansive irrigated acreage. When the Columbia Basin Project was completed in the mid-1950s, farms expanded by thousands of acres, growing potatoes, corn, onions, carrots and sugar beets. In little more than a decade, Moses Lakes population grew from 300 to 2,679 in 1950. Today, the population is 20,366 (2010 census). Larson AFB, five miles from the city of Moses Lake, Washington, originally was named Moses Lake Army Air Base. It was activated on 24 November 1942 as a World War II training center. Major Donald A. Larson, for whom the base was later renamed, was from Yakima, Washington. The Secretary of Defense announced on 19 November 1965 that Larson was to be closed by June of the following year. Larson Air Force Base, since renamed Grant County International Airport, is now a world-class heavy jet training and testing facility used by the Boeing Company, the U.S. Military and NASA.[7] Columbia Pacific Aviation now handles charter passenger service to and from Moses Lake.[8] With 4,700 acres (1,900ha) and a main runway 13,500 feet (4,110m) long, it is one of the largest airports in the United States. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 18.75 square miles (48.56km2), of which, 15.75 square miles (40.79km2) is land and 3.00 square miles (7.77km2) is water.[1] As of the census[2] of 2010, there were 20,366 people, 7,600 households, and 4,995 families residing in the city.

Unlike nearby Seattle, Moses Lake has a dry climate, and is classed as desert due to its annual rainfall. Its climate is warm during summer when temperatures tend to be in the 80\'s and somewhat cold during winter when temperatures tend to be in the 30\'s. The warmest month is July with an average maximum temperature of 88.20F. The coldest month is January with an average minimum temperature of 21.70F.

Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. In mid-summer though, it is not unusual for a month or six weeks to pass without any measurable rainfall.[9] The wettest month is December with an average rainfall of 1.19 inch (30mm). Moses Lake\'s historic economic base has been agriculture, but now includes considerable manufacturing and technology. Several companies have moved to the area, including REC Silicon (one of the worlds largest manufacturers of polysilicon, used in solar panels), as well as tech companies including Microsoft, Yahoo and Intuit who have built large data storage facilities in Moses Lake and other nearby cities. Moses Lake has also attracted some alternative fuel companies, such as Washington Ethanol & Washington Biodiesel. BMW, in partnership with the SGL Group, began construction in July 2010 on a $100 million carbon-fiber manufacturing plant, which is predicted to employ 200 persons. Other major corporations that have facilities in (or are based in) Moses Lake include: Spring Festival (Memorial Day weekend) Moses Lake Water Sports Festival (June)(first held in June 2008) Lion\'s Field, located Downtown near Frontier Middle School, was remodeled after a voter-approved levy. FieldTurf was installed and the first game held on the new turf was a soccer game between the Moses Lake Chiefs and the Wenatchee Panthers. The Football team opened the completed stadium on 12 September 2008. Moses Lake has one sister city, according to the Washington State Lt. Governor\'s list of Washington Sister Cities: Moses Lake has a long history with its sister city; Yonezawa, Japan. The two cities have been exchanging students every summer for over 20 years.

aS"Metropolitan Constantine (secular name Theodore Stanislavovich Buggan; July 29, 1936 May 21, 2012) was the Metropolitan of Irinoupolis, and Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the USA (UOC of USA), which is a jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in the United States. The primatial cathedral is in Parma, Ohio (St. Vladimir Cathedral), and the Church's head offices and Consistory are based in South Bound Brook, New Jersey.[1][2] Metropolitan Constantine was born in Pittsburgh on July 19, 1936 to Stanley (Stanislav) and Catherine Buggan, a Ukrainian family. Upon completion of his secondary education he entered the College of St. Andrew, in Winnipeg (an affiliate college with the University of Manitoba), Canada, from which he graduated in 1959. He also studied at Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary in Crestwood, New York and Duquesne University, receiving a doctorate in philosophy from the latter. On April 23, 1967 he was ordained deacon in South Bound Brook, New Jersey by Metropolitan Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) (future first patriarch of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church), and a priest on July 23 by Metropolitan John (Theodorovich), in Pittsburgh. His pastoral work comprised St. Vladimir Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois and St. Nicholas Church in Troy, New York. Father Theodore was tonsured a monk on December 18, 1971, receiving the name Constantine, and on May 7, 1972, he was consecrated by Metropolitan Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) to the Chicago cathedra of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America (UOC in America). In 1977 he was elevated to the rank of archbishop, and to metropolitan in 1982. After the death of Patriarch Mstyslav (Skrypnyk) in 1993 he became the Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America (UOC in America), and in 1994, of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in the Diaspora. In 19951996 the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in America (UOC in America) and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in the Diaspora entered in communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Metropolitan Constantine received the titular diocese of Irinoupolis. Following the will of Patriarch Dymytriy (Yarema), in the year 2000 the Council of Bishops of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, recognized Metropolitan Constantine as the spiritual head of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Ukraine. On September 27, 2000, Metropolitan Constantine named Ihor (Isichenko), Archbishop of Kharkov and Poltava as his representative in Ukraine.

aS'The Providence Journal, nicknamed the ProJo, is a daily newspaper serving the metropolitan area of Providence, Rhode Island and is the largest newspaper in Rhode Island. The newspaper, first published in 1829 and the oldest continuously-published daily newspaper in the United States, was purchased in 1996 by the A.H. Belo Corporation. The newspaper has won four Pulitzer Prizes. On June 25, 2010,[2] the Journal launched Politifact Rhode Island, a website that analyses the accuracy of claims relevant to Rhode Island that are made by political and other public figures. The feature is produced in conjunction with PolitiFact.com, created by the Tampa Bay Times. The newspaper began publishing as The Providence Daily Journal in 1832. In 1868, the Journal began to publish the afternoon paper The Evening Bulletin. In 1872 the first diner in America, a horse-drawn wagon serving hot food, was founded to serve the employees of the Providence Journal. The Journal dropped "Daily" from its name and became The Providence Journal in 1920. In 1992, the Bulletin was discontinued and its name was appended onto that of the morning paper: The Providence Journal-Bulletin. After beginning online service in 1995, the Journal established projo.com in 1996. In 1998, the paper\'s name was shortened back to The Providence Journal.[3] The Journal bills itself as "America\'s oldest daily newspaper in continuous publication," a distinction that comes from the fact that The Hartford Courant, started in 1764, did not become a daily until 1837 and The New York Post, which began daily publication in 1801, had to suspend publication during strikes in 1958 and 1978.[4] The paper\'s history has reflected the waxing and waning of newspaper popularity throughout the United States. During its heyday, the Journal had news bureaus throughout Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, a trend that had been inaugurated in 1925 by then-managing editor Sevellon Brown. Bureaus in Westerly, South Kingstown, Warwick, West Warwick, Greenville, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Newport, Bristol/Warren, Attleboro and Fall River were designed to make sure that reporters were only 20 minutes away from breaking news.[5] The paper also had a variety of regional editions, which it called zones, that focused on city and town news. The system produced an intense focus on local news typically seen only in small-town newspapers. For example, everyone who died in the Journal\'s coverage area, rich or poor, received a free staff-written obituary. But in the 1990s, those rising production costs and declines in circulation prompted the Journal to consolidate both the bureaus and the editions. (The paper, in an attempt to raise revenue, began charging for obituaries on January 4, 2005.) The editors tried to reinvigorate the coverage of city and town news in 1996, but competition from the Internet added fuel to the decline. The paper\'s last Massachusetts edition, for example, was published on March 10, 2006. On Oct. 10, 2008 the paper stopped publishing all of its zoned editions in Rhode Island and laid off 33 news staffers, including three managers. Even during the Great Depression, the Journal had not terminated news staff to cut costs. The next few years included an extensive campaign to make the Internet version of the paper profitable. The Journal aggressively marketed its news on the web, pushing to get detailed stories onto its website, projo.com, before competing radio, television and other print outlets. But circulation continued to decline and online advertising failed to compensate. On Oct. 18, 2011 with circulation down to about 94,000 on weekdays and 129,000 on Sundays (down from 164,000 and over 231,000 in 2005),[6] the Journal renamed its website providencejournal.com, a move which meant that most of the previously Internet links to its content no longer worked. It also began implementing a system to require online readers to pay for content. Interactive images of its newspaper pages were initially available on personal computers and the iPad for free. The paywall was put in place on February 28, 2012. The Providence Journal prices are: $1.00 daily, $3.50 Sunday.'

aS'A parent-teacher association (PTA) or Parent-Teacher-Student Association (PTSA) is a formal organization composed of parents, teachers and staff that is intended to facilitate parental participation in a school. They occur in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan and may occur in other countries. In the U.S., most public and private K-8 schools have a PTA, a Parent Teacher Organization or an equivalent local organization. These organizations also occur (though less frequently) at high schools and preschools. Groups going by the PTA acronym are part of the National Parent Teacher Association (National PTA), a non-profit formerly based in Chicago (now in Alexandria, Virginia) that was founded on February 17, 1897, with membership open to anyone who believes in its mission and purposes. The first meeting was held in Marietta, Georgia by Alice McLellen Birney at Marietta High School.[1] Every person who joins a local PTA automatically becomes a member of both the state and National PTAs. PTA membership  including the number of affiliated units and of individual members  has been declining for several decades. The group boasted more than 12 million members in the late 1960s; today membership is down below 5.2 million.[2] On June 28, 2009, Chuck Saylors became the 113-year-old group\'s first male president. According to Saylors, only about 10% of the formerly all-female group\'s members are men.[3] Local groups doing similar work but that are unassociated with the state and national structure of the National PTA are often known as Parent Teacher Organizations (PTOs). A number of other acronyms are used as well. In the United States, roughly 25% of parent groups are PTAs, while the remainder are independent. There are 23,000 local organizations recognized by the National PTA in the United States.[2] In the United Kingdom Parent Teacher Associations are common, being present in the majority of schools (sometimes called Home School Associations). An NFER study "How are schools involving parents in school life? Annual survey of trends in education 2007" found that 83 per cent of primary schools, and 60 per cent of secondary schools had a "PTA or equivalent".[4] In England, Wales and Northern Ireland PTAs may choose to join PTA-UK[5] which describes itself as "The national charity representing over 13,750 PTAs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland" which seeks "To advance education by encouraging the fullest co-operation between home and school, education authorities, central government and all other interested parties and bodies." Unlike the USA the fact that a body is called a PTA does not, in itself, imply membership of any national organisation. There is a separate, similar body for Scotland. "The Scottish Parent Teacher Council"[6] PTAs are, in general not involved in the Governance of Schools, that is a matter for the school governing bodies, but in practice parents who are active in the PTA will tend to engage in the elections of parent representatives (Parent Governors).'

After unsuccessfully trying to bait Gorgopas to come out and fight, the Athenians sailed away at night fall. The lead Athenian ship carried a customary light which the other ships could follow. Gorgopas, keeping his ships dark, followed the light of the Athenian ship. He was able to surprise the Athenian fleet as it passed close to shore around Cape Zoster.

aS'The Radiators are an Australian pub rock band formed in September 1978. Mainstay members are Brian Nichol on lead vocals and guitar, Stephen "Fess" Parker on lead guitar and Geoff Turner on bass guitar. In 1987 they were joined by Mark Lucas on drums. Their most popular albums are Feel the Heat (March 1980) and Scream of the Real (May 1983), which both peaked in the top25 of the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Their best known songs are "Coming Home", "No Tragedy" and "Gimme Head". Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane described the group as "an archetypal, hard-working pub-rock band capable of delivering tightly crafted, well-executed, hard-hitting metal-pop anthems backed by a playful sense of humour. The band toured constantly, racking up over 2500 gigs by the early 1990s". The Radiators were formed in Western Sydney in September 1978 as a pub rock band with Brendan Callinan on keyboards and vocals, Brian Nichol on lead vocals and guitar, Stephen "Fess" Parker on lead guitar, Chris Tagg on drums and Geoff Turner on bass guitar.[1] Nichol and Parker grew up in Bega where they attended the local high school. They formed a local group, Undecided, and in 1969 they relocated to Sydney.[2] Callinan, Nichol, Parker and Tagg were all ex-members of hard rockers, Big Swifty which had formed in 1975.[1] Turner had been in Twister which had issued two singles in 1977 prior to disbanding.[1] The Radiators signed with WEA Records and issued their debut single, "Comin\' Home" in September 1979.[1] It peaked at No.33 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.[3] A second single, "Gimme Head", appeared in February 1980.[1] In March 1980 the group released their first album, Feel the Heat, which was produced by Charles Fisher (Radio Birdman, Ol\' 55).[4] They supported the Australian leg of a tour by United Kingdom rock group, The Police.[1] In 1981 Powderworks Records released "Up for Grabs" in October, which reached the top40.[1][3] They followed with "Nothing\'s Changed" in December.[1] The Radiators signed with EMI Records and, in May 1983, issued the album, Scream of the Real, which peaked at No.15 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart.[1][3] That month its lead single, "No Tragedy" reached the top30.[1][3] In 1984 they released Life\'s a Gamble, which became their third platinum album.[1] In June Tagg was replaced on drums by Mick Buckley.[1][4] The group toured constantly, averaging 200 gigs a year and by 1985 had performed an estimated 1500 times, Turner explained, "Your fingers and throat start hurting ... It\'s a bit of a grind and it seems never-ending... [but] there\'s nothing else we\'d rather do than play rock and roll. I can\'t imagine life without the Rads".[5] In late 1986, they signed with Mercury Records and released Nasty Habits in Nice Children in March 1987, which was produced by Peter Blyton (Chain).[1][4] That June, Buckley was replaced on drums by Brad Heaney.[1][4] Heaney was replaced in turn by Mark Lucas and then in 1988 Callinan left without being replaced.[1][4] In January 1989 Heaney was a founding member of hard rock group, The Screaming Jets.[6] By the early 1990s, the band\'s "boogie rock" style was outmoded and Turner noted that media referred to their fans as "mindless yobbos from the west".[1][5] However, rock music author, James Cockington, felt "[p]art of their appeal is their refusal to change their style, so that a 1978 gig and a 1998 gig are strangely similar experiences".[5] Further albums include Radiators (October 1993), Stone (September 1995), In the Roar (1997) and Smoke and Mirrors (2000).[1][4] In 2001 veteran Australian guitarist Ted Mulry was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and a series of tribute concerts, Gimme Ted, were organised. The Radiators\' performance on 10 March was recorded with seven-tracks issued on a 2 DVD as Gimme Ted  The Ted Mulry Benefit Concerts by Various Artists (2003).[7] The Radiators appeared in the Countdown Spectacular 2 concert series in Australia between late-August and early-September 2007.[8] They sang two songs including "Comin\' Home", which was issued on the associated 3 CD set, Countdown Spectacular Live  Volume Two (2007). According to the band\'s website, as of 2008, the line up of Lucas, Nichol, Parker and Turner celebrated the group\'s 30th anniversary and toured throughout Australia.[9] In June 2009 they performed at the 31st Annual Golden Stave Charity Luncheon at Sydney\'s Hordern Pavilion.[10] Their best known songs are "Comin\' Home", "No Tragedy" and "Gimme Head" (covered in 2004 by Melbourne band, Your Wedding Night). Rock music historian, Ian McFarlane described the group as "an archetypal, hard-working pub-rock band capable of delivering tightly crafted, well-executed, hard-hitting metal-pop anthems backed by a playful sense of humour. The band toured constantly, racking up over 2500 gigs by the early 1990s".[1] Aside from his work with The Radiators, Lucas has taught drumming since the mid-1980s including students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).[11] As of 2008, Callinan is a sales and marketing manager of Roland Corporation and an executive committee member of Support Act Limited.[12] In May 2008, Buckley was a member of country music group, The Yeehaa Boys  alongside Steve Balbi (Noiseworks)  which issued a self-titled album.[13]'

aS'Mara Takla Haymanot was Ngus ngst of Ethiopia, and the founder of the Zagwe dynasty. Some King Lists give his name simply as "Mararah", and other King Lists as "Takla Haymanot".[1] According to one tradition, Mara was born in the province of Lasta, which was his power base. Originally a general of Dil Na\'od, whose daughter Masoba Warq became his wife, Mara overthrew his father-in-law to found the new dynasty.[2] James Bruce, on the other hand, presents another tradition that Dil Na\'od was overthrown by Gudit, and that Mara Takla Haymanot (whom Bruce calls "Takla Haymanot") was a cousin of Gudit who succeeded her after several of her own family.[3] There is some disagreement over the exact time when he came to the throne: there are two different traditions for how long the Zagwe dynasty ruled: the more common tradition states that it was for 333 years, while a less common one gives the time as 133 years. The Italian scholar Carlo Conti Rossini accepted the shorter period, and working back from the accepted date of 1270 for the end of the Zagwe dynasty, claims that this dynasty started around 1137. He supported this theory with the recorded exchange between Patriarch John V of Alexandria and an unnamed king of Ethiopia, who asked for a new abuna because the current one was too old; Conti Rossini argued that the actual reason was that the abuna refused to condone the coup which resulted in Mara Takla Haymanot gaining the throne.[2] The extent of his kingdom was much smaller than the later Solomonic dynasty came to rule, embracing parts of Lasta, Wag, Tigray, and perhaps northern Begemder.'

aS'The 6.555mm (designated as the 6.5x55 Swedish by the SAAMI[5] and 6,5  55 SE by the C.I.P.[6]) is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. Other less common names are 6.555mm Swedish Mauser, 6.555mm Mauser and 6.555mm Krag. It was developed in 1891 for use in the new service rifles then under consideration by the United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway. The two nations had independent armies and consequently the normal procedure at the time was for their respective governments to use the same ammunition and then purchase small arms of their choice. Norway adopted the Krag-Jrgensen rifle, while Sweden adopted a Mauser rifle design. The 6.555mm cartridge has a smaller bullet diameter and lower recoil than other full-power service rifle cartridges like the .30-06 Springfield and 7.9257mm Mauser, but thanks in part to its relatively roomy case with an uncommon 12.2mm (0.480in) diameter bolt face which was designed for loading long, heavy 6.5 mm bullets has proven more successful than other first-generation smokeless-powder military cartridges of similar caliber such as the 660mm US Navy, 6.554mm Mannlicher-Schnauer, 6.553mm Dutch Mannlicher, 6.552mm Carcano and 6.550mm Arisaka. The 6.555mm has 3.75 ml (57.9 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles and machine guns alike, under extreme conditions.  6.555mm maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm). Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2  25.6 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 220mm (1 in 8.66in), 4 grooves,  lands = 6.50mm,  grooves = 6.73mm, land width = 2.5mm and the primer type is large rifle. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l\'Epreuve des Armes  Feu Portatives) rulings the 6.555mm can handle up to 380.00MPa (55,114psi) Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.[7] This means that 6.555mm chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2013) proof tested at 475.00MPa (68,893psi) PE piezo pressure.\nThe German 6.5x57mm and the American .260 Remington cartridges are probably the closest European and American ballistic twins of the 6.555mm. The .260 Remington being a post World War II .308 Winchester-derived cartridge developed by Remington to provide 6.555mm performance in a short bolt action format. The SAAMI Maximum Average Pressure (MAP) for this cartridge is 51,000psi (351.6MPa) piezo pressure (46,000 CUP).[8][9] All Swedish Mauser bolt actions were proof tested with a single 6.555mm proof round developing approximately 455MPa (65,992psi) piezo pressure (55,000 CUP).[10][11] Due to different interpretations of the standard, i.e. the standards of manufacturing using maximum chamber in the Krag vs. minimum chamber in the Swedish Mauser, a small percentage of the ammunition produced in Norway required a heavy push on the bolt handle to chamber in the Swedish Mauser rifle. After the rumor of this difference first surfaced in 1900, it was examined by the Swedish military. They declared the difference to be insignificant, and that both the Swedish and Norwegian ammunition was within the specified parameters laid down for the 6,555mm. Despite this finding, the Swedish weapon-historian Josef Alm repeated the rumor in a book in the 1930s, leading many to believe that there was a significant difference. The militaries of Sweden and Norway loaded their 6.555mm skarp patron m/94 projektil m/94 (live cartridge m/94 projectile m/94) service ammunition with a 10.1 grams (156gr) long round-nosed m/94 (B-projectile) bullet fired at a muzzle velocity of 725m/s (2,379ft/s) with 2,654J (1,957ftlbf) muzzle energy from a 739mm (29.1in) long barrel up to the early phase of World War II and Norwegian occupation by German in 1940. From 1941 onwards Sweden, which remained neutral during World War II, adopted skarp patron m/94 prickskytte m/41 (live cartridge m/94 sniping m/41) ammunition loaded with a 9.1 grams (140gr) spitzer bullet (D-projectile) fired at a muzzle velocity of 800m/s (2,625ft/s) with 2,912J (2,148ftlbf) muzzle energy from a 739mm (29.1in) long barrel.[12] Besides a pointed nose the m/41 D-projectile also had a boat tail. Originally developed for the m/41 sniper rifle, this new cartridge replaced the m/94 ammunition loaded with the M/94 projectile for general use.[13] Besides the two skarp patron (live full metal jacket ball cartridge) variants various other military 6.555mm ammunition types like tracer, blank, inert and training cartridges were available. The Swedish military ammunition was loaded to 320MPa (46,412psi) piezo pressure.[14] The 6.555mm cartridge was used by Norway in the Krag-Jrgensen bolt action rifle and in the Madsen machine gun, as well as in several prototype self-loading rifles. In Swedish service, the 6.555mm cartridge was used in the Swedish Mauser family of bolt action arms comprising the m/94 (Model 1894) carbine, m/96 (Model 1896) long rifle, m/38 (Model 1938) short rifle and m/41 (Model 1941) sniper rifle and the Ag m/42 semi-automatic rifle.[15] The Swedish Mauser arms had a relatively tight 200mm (1 in 7.87in) twist rate optimized for stabilizing the relatively long heavy bullets used in the Swedish 6.555mm military service ammunition. It was also used in several light, medium and heavy machine guns such as the Schwarzlose, Browning BAR, Kg/1940 Light machine gun, Bren Gun, Browning M1917, Browning M1919 and FN MAG. The FN MAG was eventually returned to its original 7.6251mm NATO chambering when the Swedish armed forces switched to that cartridge as its standard during the post-World War II era. The 6.555mm cartridge is highly esteemed as a hunting round in Europe (particularly in Scandinavia), and North America. It is used for harvesting most kind of game including reindeer and moose in Scandinavia, while in most other countries it is used for taking deer and other medium-sized game. Sportsmen who favor the round load the combination of low recoil coupled with the cartridge\'s inherent accuracy and superb penetrative qualities. Despite its enduring popularity amongst a devoted niche of American sportsmen, U.S. rifle manufacturers have, for the most part, ignored the cartridge. There is currently no mainstream American arms manufacturer chambering a rifle model for the 6.555mm. European rifle makers including Blaser, CZ, Sauer & Sohn, Steyr and Mauser Jagdwaffen GmbH offer sporting rifles chambered for this cartridge, as does the Finnish arms manufacturer SAKO/Tikka, while ammunition manufacturers such as Norma, Lapua, Prvi Partizan, RUAG Ammotec and Hornady offer loadings of the 6.555mm round that are designed for use only in modern hunting rifles that can tolerate higher chamber pressures. These modern loadings should never be used in older military rifles.[citation needed] Because 6.5mm (.264") bullets have relatively high ballistic coefficients, the 6.555mm has seen success in long range target matches of 300m (328yd)  1,000m (1,094yd). The 6.555mm cartridge was widely used in biathlon competition until 1975 (when it was replaced by the .22 Long Rifle (.22 LR) rimfire cartridge), because of its inherent accuracy and historical popularity with the Scandinavian nations who have dominated this sport.The 6.555mm was and is used for 1,000yd (914.4m) target shooting disciplines like F class. The cartridge is also used by Scandinavian target shooters that use the Sauer 200 STR (Scandinavian Target Rifle) as their competition rifle. The 6.555mm case is also used as the parent case for modified variants that are not officially registered with or sanctioned by C.I.P. or its American equivalent, SAAMI. Such cartridges which use commercial factory cases are generally known as wildcats. By changing the shape of standard factory cases (decreasing case taper and/or changing the shoulder geometry) the wildcatter generally increases the case capacity of the factory parent cartridge case, allowing more propellant to be used to generate higher velocities. Besides changing the shape and internal volume of the parent cartridge case, wildcatters also can change the original calibre. A reason to change the original calibre can be to comply with a minimal permitted calibre or bullet weight for the legal hunting of certain species of game. Because the 6.555mm offers a relatively wide short cartridge case that can be relatively easily reloaded and hence be reused several times it has been used by wildcatters. With the 6.555mm as the parent case wildcatters have created the 6.555mm Ackley Impoved In the 6.555mm Ackley Impoved the cartridge case capacity is raised to approximately 4.03 ml (62.2 grains H2O). The Ackley Improved family of wildcat cartridges are designed to be easily made by rechambering existing firearms, and fireforming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle, resulting in a higher case capacity.'

It is located close to the border with Sweden in the municipalities of Os, and Engerdal in Hedmark county and Rros in Sr-Trndelag county. Femundsmarka National Park borders the northeastern part of the lake.[1] The 204-square-kilometre (79sqmi) lake holds about 6 cubic kilometres (1.4cumi) of water and reaches a maximum depth of 130 metres (430ft). The surface of the lake sits about 662 metres (2,172ft) above sea level. The first element (Fe- or Fem-) has no known meaning, and the last element is the suffix -mund or -und (both are common in Norwegian place names).[1] After Sweden conquered the parishes of Idre and Srna in 1644 the lake Femunden was considered to be the border between Norway and Sweden. But this was never officially recognised by Norway, and in 1751 was Femundsmarka on the east side of the lake granted to Norway from Sweden. The new (and current) border from 1751 is quite special: For a length of 61 kilometers it makes a completely straight line between the mountaintops of Vndsjgusten (1002 meter) and sterhogna (1185 meter)."

aS'Jammu and Kashmir is the northernmost state in India. In the seventeenth century the Mughal emperor Jahangir set his eyes on the valley of Kashmir. He said that if paradise is anywhere on the earth, it is here, while living in a houseboat on Dal Lake. "Gar firdaus, ruhe zamin ast, hamin asto, hamin asto, hamin ast." If there is ever a heaven on earth, its here, its here, its here. In Jammu and Kashmir the most important tourist places are Kashmir, Srinagar, the Mughal Gardens, Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Jammu, and Ladakh. Some areas require a special permit for non-Indians to visit. Before militancy intensified in 1989, tourism formed an important part of the Kashmiri economy. The tourism economy in the Kashmir valley was worst hit. However, the holy shrines of Jammu and the Buddhist monasteries of Ladakh continue to remain popular pilgrimage and tourism destinations. Every year, thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit holy shrines of Vaishno Devi and Amarnath which has had significant impact on the state\'s economy.[1] The Vaishno Devi yatra alone contributes Rs. 475 crore to the local economy annually.[2] Tourism in the Kashmir valley has rebounded in recent years and in 2009, the state became one of the top tourist destinations of India.[3] Gulmarg, one of the most popular ski resort destinations in India, is also home to the world\'s highest green golf course.[4] However with the decrease in violence in the state has boosted the states economy specifically tourism.[5] It was reported that 7.36 lakh tourists visited Kashmir in 2010 including 23,000 foreigners.[6] In 2011, the number of tourist arrivals in Kashmir touched the mark of 10 lakh.[6][7][8] The state\'s official language is Urdu. However, the main languages spoken are Kashmiri in the Kashmir Valley, Ladakhi in Ladakh and Dogri in Jammu. Most people can speak Hindi as a second language. As elsewhere in India, English is fairly widely spoken among the educated classes and those involved in the tourist industry. Flights operate to Jammu, Srinagar and Leh. Try Indian Airlines [4], Jet Airways [5], Kingfisher [6], Indigo Airlines [7] and SpiceJet [8]. The last stop on the railway line north is Udhampur, where you can catch onward buses and hire SUVs/MUVs (Tata Sumo / Toyota Innova/ Mahindra Scorpio). However it is better to get down in Jammu and catch a taxi from there as these are more readily available. The Kashmir Railway is a railway line being built in India to connect the state of Jammu and Kashmir with the rest of the country. The Project officially coded USBRL (Udhampur Srinagar Baramulla Railway Link) starts from the city of Udhampur, 55 kilometres (34 mi) north of Jammu, and travels for 290 kilometres (180 mi) to the city of Baramulla on the northwestern edge of the Kashmir Valley. The route crosses major earthquake zones, and is subjected to extreme temperatures of cold and heat, as well as inhospitable terrain, making it an extremely challenging engineering project. There are two ways to get in by land - via Jammu and up to Srinagar or via Manali in Himachal Pradesh and up to Leh. Gulmarg is well known for its amazing natural beauty and it is counted as one of the unique tourist destinations in the world. Gulmarg is surrounded by dense forest. This place is famous for its golf hikes and beautiful highland golf course. The natural beauty accompanied with clean fresh air and a beautiful environment highlights Gulmarg as a major tourist destination. The way to reach Sonamarg or the Meadow of the gold is from the sindh valley. This valley also shows more amazing facet in kashmir.

aS'The Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL) was a rebel group that participated in the First Liberian Civil War under the leadership of Prince Johnson.[1] It was a breakaway faction of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). The INPFL was formed by Prince Johnson after a leadership dispute with NPFL leader Charles Taylor over his authority as self-proclaimed head of the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government (NPRAG), an alternative government that was based in the Bong County town of Gbarnga. Initially estimated at less than 500 troops, the INPFL was a significant force in the early stages of the war. It controlled a number of strategic points within the capital city of Monrovia and facilitated the deployment of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) cease-fire monitoring group forces, known as ECOMOG. It was the INPFL, which captured and murdered President Samuel Doe in September 1990. The faction disintegrated in the wake of internal wrangling over its level of co-operation with the interim government, ECOMOG and the NPFL. Through 1991, its role in the conflict substantially declined and the faction formally disbanded in late 1992.'

aS'They Came Back (French: Les Revenants) is a French zombie film, originally released in 2004. The film was screened at the Hamburg Fantasy Filmfest in Hamburg, Germany, the Venice Film Festival in Italy, and the Toronto Film Festival in Canada. Unlike modern zombie films, in which the undead characters wish to digest or otherwise harm the human characters, the 70 million people who return from the dead in They Came Back want simply to re-integrate themselves into society. In the French village where the film takes place, the town\'s population must cope with the social and emotional ramifications of the dead coming back to life. The dead are not unlike children, having to relearn how to talk and remember.[1] As the movie begins, a slow moving mostly gray haired crowd walk through a French town. These people are clean, combed, and casually dressed. Integration with society becomes the first issue that concerns the town politics. While the authorities monitor and record movements, habits, sociability, and intelligence the personal relationships between the returned and their respective live spouses and parents comes into the foreground. Painful memories are awakened, guilt, fear, love, even unearthed passions are aroused. However, monitoring the returnees shows them to be very much apart from their live cohabitants and in fact involved in late night clandestine meetings, seemingly plotting with more intelligence than they are exhibiting in their day jobs. The Village Voice remarked, "They Came Back suffers from long-winded earnestness and, despite some poetic conceits, its allegory ultimately doesn\'t parse."[2] J.C. Maek III of WorldsGreatestCritic.com and PopMatters wrote, "This one may be hard to swallow in its ambiguity and surreal normalcy.

aS'Locus control regions (LCR) are defined by their ability to enhance the expression of linked genes to physiological levels in a tissue-specific and copy number-dependent manner at ectopic chromatin sites.[1] The concept derives from the idea that developmental and cell lineage-specific regulation of gene expression relies not only on gene-proximal elements such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, but also on long-range interactions of various cis-regulatory elements and dynamic chromatin alterations. The LCR was identified over 20 years ago. In transgenic mouse studies it was determined that the LCR was required for normal regulation of beta-globin gene expression.[2] Several models exist for how the LCR exerts its effects on transcription from a distance.'

aS'Emotional exhaustion is a chronic state of physical and emotional depletion that results from excessive job and/or personal demands and continuous stress.[1] It describes a feeling of being emotionally overextended and exhausted by one\'s work. It is manifested by both physical fatigue and a sense of feeling psychologically and emotionally "drained".[2] Most emotional exhaustion research has been guided by Maslach\'s and Jackson\'s three-component conceptualization of burnout. This model suggests burnout consists of three interrelated parts: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment. Depersonalization, also called "dehumanization", refers to a set of callous and insensitive behaviors displayed by a worker toward a client.[citation needed] Diminished personal accomplishment refers to negative evaluations of the self.[3][4][5] The level of emotional exhaustion which is experienced by an employee is influenced by a variety of determinants, such as: personal resources, coping strategies, emotional culture, and supervisory regulation of display rules. Personal resources, such as status, social support, money or shelter, may reduce or prevent an employee\'s emotional exhaustion. According to the Conservation of Resources theory (COR), people strive to obtain, retain and protect their personal resources, either instrumental (e.g., money or shelter), social (e.g., social support or status) or psychological (e.g., self-esteem or sense of autonomy). The COR\'s theory suggest that people must invest resources in order to protect against resource loss, recover from losses, and regain resources. Therefore, those with greater resources are less vulnerable to resource loss and more capable of orchestrating resource gain, whereas, for those with fewer resources, ongoing resource loss may result in a rapid influential loss spiral. [6] [7] [8] [9] In a field study, those experiencing higher levels of job autonomy (the freedom to take initiative and exercise discretion in decision-making), low task complexity, supervisory support, and the internal locus of control (a tendency to attribute events to one\'s own control; such as, the tendency to attribute a success to internal causes, like one\'s ability or effort, rather than external causes, such as good luck), tend to experience lower degrees of emotional exhaustion .[10] Similarly, researchers reveal that even though higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees\' emotional exhaustion, when employees believe that they have autonomy in their job behaviors, emotion regulation, that is otherwise exhausting, is not associated with exhaustion at all .[11] Another field study, basing on a sample of call-center workers in a large telecommunications corporation, indicate that employees who are highly identified with the service work, possess higher levels of self-efficacy (the belief in one\'s ability to succeed;[12]), and receive social support from their supervisors, are less likely to experience emotional exhaustion.[13] Researchers suggest that emotional exhaustion may be a result of using inadequate strategies in order to cope with problematic events on the job. Accordingly, there are empirical evidences that employees, who tend to use more control strategies, which are considered more productive strategies (concerned with addressing the situation; such as direct action and help seeking) tend to experience lower levels of emotional exhaustion than do those who tend to use more escape strategies, which are considered inadequate strategies, (used to avoid problems; such as avoidance and resignation with the problematic situation). [10] Regional and national cultures have been shown to have different norms for emotional expressions,[14] and vary in their expectations for regulating and expressing emotions in the workplace.[15] Such differences are part of the emotional culture of those cultures. For example, some cultures are more institutionally-oriented, with strong norms about regulating emotions to fulfill institutional roles and standards, whereas other cultures are more impulsively-oriented that value expressing unregulated emotions.[16] An example of a culture with a strong institutional-orientation toward emotions is the United States, due to the strong American norm to act positively and hide negative feelings, ("the service with a smile" norm);[17] Whereas, France can be used as an example of a country with a more impulsive-orientation toward emotions.[18] People within cultures that tend to use an impulsive orientation to understand and evaluate social situations are likely to feel more personal control over their expressions, than people within institutional-oriented cultures, resulting in more of a buffer against strain and emotional exhaustion.[16] On the basis of those arguments, an organizational research investigated the influence of emotional culture on the degree of emotional exhaustion experienced by employees who work on jobs that include interaction with clients and emotional labor demands. In this study, among employees working at such jobs, those who belonged to more impulsive-oriented culture (France) showed lower degrees of emotional exhaustion, than those who belonged to more institutional-oriented culture (U.S.).[11] Supervisors are likely to be important definers of interpersonal demands at the job level, given their direct influence on worker\'s beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors\' impressions of the importance of display rules (the rules about what kind of emotions are allowed to be expressed on the job) influence the employees\' impressions of that display rules.[19][20] Recent study also suggests that employees who hold the same job (e.g., call center representatives) may experience the same "display rules" differently if they work for different supervisors, who vary in the emphasis they place on their subordinates\' interpersonal role requirements, and by so, experience different levels of emotional exhaustion. Such that having a supervisor who places greater importance on interpersonal job demands results in greater emotional exhaustion (especially for those subordinates who have low career identity) .[13] Current models of how emotion regulation impacts strain focus on intraindividual processes that operate within the mind and body of the person regulating the emotion, but these models have several limitations [21] Cote (2005) suggests a social interaction model that takes into account these limitations. In this model, work strain is predicted according to: According to Cote (2005), interpersonal feedback is far more potent than intraindividual feedback, and dominates if the two processes are in opposition. The social interaction model suggests an alternate route by which to proceed with theory building and future research. Researches have linked emotional exhaustion to a plethora of ailments, and a general breakdown in feelings of community.[5] However, a growing body of research has begun to demonstrate that emotional exhaustion can have deleterious consequences for organizations as well; For example, Russell Cropanzano and his colleagues, in their two field studies, indicate that exhausted employees show lower organizational commitment, lower job performance, less organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) directed toward the organization (OCBO) and their supervisors (OCBS), and higher turnover intentions. They suggest that emotional exhaustion can be seen as a cost that qualifies the value of any benefits received through employment, and so that an organization, which overworks its employees to the point of emotional exhaustion, may be seen as unfair. [24] Similarly, longitudinal studies found that exhausted employees show not only lower job performance, but also more absences, and greater likelihood of seeking employment elsewhere (actual voluntary turnover).[1][25]'

aS'The axiom of countable choice or axiom of denumerable choice, denoted AC, is an axiom of set theory (a special case of the axiom of choice). It states that any countable collection of non-empty sets must have a choice function. Spelled out, this means that if A is a function with domain N (where N denotes the set of natural numbers) and A(n) is a non-empty set for every nN, then there exists a function f with domain N such that f(n)A(n) for every nN. Paul Cohen showed that AC is not provable in ZermeloFraenkel set theory (ZF) without the axiom of choice (AC). A common misconception is that countable choice has an inductive nature and is therefore provable as a theorem (in ZF, or similar, or even weaker systems) by induction. However, this is not the case; this misconception is the result of confusing countable choice with finite choice for a finite set of size n (for arbitrary n), and it is this latter result (which is an elementary theorem in combinatorics) that is provable by induction. However, some countably infinite sets of nonempty sets can be proven to have a choice function in ZF without any form of the axiom of choice. These include V{} and the set of proper and bounded open intervals of real numbers with rational endpoints. ZF + AC suffices to prove that the union of countably many countable sets is countable. It also suffices to prove that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite (equivalently: has a countably infinite subset). AC is particularly useful for the development of analysis, where many results depend on having a choice function for a countable collection of sets of real numbers. For instance, in order to prove that every accumulation point x of a set SR is the limit of some sequence of elements of S\\{x}, one uses (a weak form of) the axiom of countable choice. When formulated for accumulation points of arbitrary metric spaces, the statement becomes equivalent to AC. For other statements equivalent to AC, see (Herrlich 1997)[1] and (Howard/Rubin 1998).[2] AC is a weak form of the axiom of choice (AC). AC states that every collection of non-empty sets must have a choice function. AC clearly implies the axiom of dependent choice (DC), and DC is sufficient to show AC. However AC is strictly weaker than DC[3] (and DC is strictly weaker than AC). As an example of an application of AC, here is a proof (from ZF+AC) that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite: This article incorporates material from axiom of countable choice on PlanetMath, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License.'

aS"Alice Upside Down is a film adaptation of the Alice series written by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor. The film was shot at Bishop DuBourg High School in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Screened in limited cinema in 2007, it was released wide straight-to-DVD on July 29, 2008. In North America, it airs on Starz Kids & Family, but in the early years, it was on demand. In Latin America, the movie was shown on Disney Channel. The film's plot centers around Alice (Alyson Stoner), an 11-year-old girl starting the sixth grade at a new school. This is a coming-of-age story. Alice McKinley (Alyson Stoner) is an 11-year-old girl who is facing many challenges. Her mother Marie died when she was young, so she never really got to know her. She lives with her brother Lester (Lucas Grabeel) and her father, Ben (Luke Perry). Then they move to a new house, and the neighbors Elizabeth (Parker McKenna Posey) and her mother introduce themselves. The next day Alice goes to school with Elizabeth, and tells her she's really nervous. She runs into a guy Patrick (Dylan McLaughlin) whom she accidentally walked in on. They line up to find their teachers, and Alice really hopes she's in Miss Cole's (Ashley Drane) class. But instead she winds up with the evil Mrs. Plotkin (Penny Marshall) who gives her a hard time. Alice tries out for a play Miss. Cole's class is directing, and really wants the princess role. But she can't really sing that well, and her arch rival Pamela (Bridgit Mendler) gets the part instead. And Alice lands the role of a frog. Pamela hasn't been very nice to Alice ever since she came to school. Such as telling her secret about Patrick, and trying to steal Elizabeth away, and embarrassing Alice at a restaurant. Alice tells her dad and brother about it, but they tell her that she could never really sing. Her dad opens a new shop, and Alice tries to hook her dad and Miss Cole up, but her dad says she is too young for him. Then her dad starts dating a new girl, Kelly, and Alice is afraid her father will marry her. On top on that, Alice sneaks downstairs one night and see her father and Kelly kissing, and it really hurts her. Their father's sister, Aunt Sally (Ann Dowd) and her husband come to visit. Their father finds Aunt Sally tedious, because she thinks they can't take care of themselves. As they're preparing, Alice finds a video of her mother, and later watches the video. But her father reprimands her, saying that those videos were private. Back at school, Alice slowly begins to bond with Mrs. Plotkin, and finds that she isn't the witch everyone thinks she is. And she finds out that Miss Cole isn't the all-together person she appears to be, and finds it's all an illusion. The night of the play, Alice accidentally tears down the set, and everyone is upset at her, even Miss Cole. They tell her to leave, but Mrs. Plotkin is right there to help her though. After the play, everyone apologizes, even Pamela. At the end of the movie, Pamela and Alice are friends, Patrick asks Alice out, which leads to her having a daydream about her and Patrick kissing, and Lester is seen playing with his band, the Naked Nomads. Alice Upside Down is a soundtrack album by the film of the same name, released on September 16, 2008 by Dauman Music and distributed by Federal Distribution[2]"

aS'The 2006 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup was a ten-race series that commenced with the Sylvania 300 on September 17, 2006 at New Hampshire International Speedway and concluded with the Ford 400 on November 19 of that same year at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The Top Ten drivers and their teams (and any other drivers with teams within 400 points of the leader) qualify after the Chevy Rock and Roll 400 on September 9, 2006 at Richmond International Raceway. The 2006 Chase had a strong Chevrolet presence, with seven of the ten teams making the 2006 Chase for the NEXTEL Cup fielding Chevrolets. This was the final season for NBC to cover the Chase along with TNT. Starting in 2007, ABC will carry the Chase in its entirety, while TNT will carry mid-season races. The Sylvania 300 was held on September 17, 2006 at New Hampshire International Speedway The 2005 winner was Ryan Newman, who failed to make the chase this year. The defending track champion was Kyle Busch. Kevin Harvick won the pole and the race. The Dover 400 was held on September 24, 2006 at the Dover International Speedway. The 2005 winner was Jimmie Johnson who started the chase second in points. Matt Kenseth won the spring event. At this year\'s race, Jeff Gordon won the pole and Matt Kenseth led the most laps. But it was Jeff Burton, who hadn\'t won in over 175 races, that prevailed and took the lead in the standings.  - Holds tiebreaker with more wins The Banquet 400 was held on October 1, 2006 at the Kansas Speedway. The 2005 winner was Mark Martin who started the chase seventh in points. Additionally, this race was held a week earlier than in 2005. Kasey Kahne won the pole. A fuel milage gamble would have put Jimmie Johnson in great position for Talladega by winning, but he ran out of gas with four laps to go. Tony Stewart took the lead and won a wild one by running out of gas in Turn 2 but still making it all the way around the track to the finish line. The UAW-Ford 500 was held on October 8 at the newly repaved Talladega Superspeedway. Considered the wild card track in the Chase, all drivers fear that they will be caught in "The Big One." The 2005 winner was Dale Jarrett who missed the chase this year. The defending track champion was Jimmie Johnson. The race was held one week later than in 2005. At this year\'s event, David Gilliland won his first career Bud Pole Award, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. led the most laps. In a wild finish, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. led going into turn 3 on the final lap, with Jimmie Johnson and Brian Vickers trailing. Johnson moved down low to pass Earnhardt, and his teammate Vickers followed, but accidentally caught the right rear quarter panel of Johnson\'s Chevrolet. Johnson spun up into Earnhardt\'s car, sending both of them down into the infield grass. Vickers moved past and took his first career victory, amid boos from Earnhardt\'s and Johnson\'s fans. The Bank of America 500 was held on October 14 at the Lowe\'s Motor Speedway. The 2005 winner was Jimmie Johnson who won two of the three races in Charlotte that year. The defending track champion was Kasey Kahne, however Johnson was the defending champion for 500-mile races at the track. At this year\'s event, Scott Riggs won the pole and Kasey Kahne led the most laps. Championship contender Mark Martin was involved in a hard crash after being tagged by J. J. Yeley. The Subway 500 was held on October 22 at the Martinsville Speedway. The 2005 winner was Jeff Gordon who started the chase ninth in points this year and also won both races at the track in 2003. The defending track champion was Tony Stewart. On lap 188, the entire complexity of the Chase was changed. The consistent Jeff Burton, who had been involved in a previous accident, had engine troubles which relegated him to a 42nd place finish. Jimmie Johnson led the most laps and won the race. The Bass Pro Shops 500 was held on October 29 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. The 2005 winner was Carl Edwards who missed the chase this year. The defending track champion was Kasey Kahne. Matt Kenseth was awarded the pole after qualifying was washed out, but Tony Stewart spoiled the party winning the race.   Hold tiebreaker. The Dickies 500 was held on November 5 at the Texas Motor Speedway. The 2005 winner was Carl Edwards. The defending track champion was Kasey Kahne. The race was extended five laps due to the green-white-checkers rule, and for the second week in a row, Tony Stewart played spoiler and won the event. The Checker Auto Parts 500 presented by Pennzoil Platinum was held on November 12 at the Phoenix International Raceway. Kevin Harvick swept the season\'s races (having won the Subway Fresh 500 back in April) with the win here, while Jeff Gordon won the pole for this race. At one point in this race, all ten drivers were in the top dozen, but Kyle Busch, who came in as the defending champion of this race and began the Chase in fifth place, was involved in a late race crash, becoming one of five drivers to be mathematically eliminated from the Chase before Homestead. ~ - Mathematically eliminated from Chase as of this race.  - Holds tiebreaker with more wins. The Ford 400 was held on November 19 at the Homestead-Miami Speedway. Greg Biffle, who missed the chase this year, defended his championship for the third time. The race was also the swan song (for at least the next eight years) for NBC\'s telecasts. Kasey Kahne won the pole for this race, while Jimmie Johnson took ninth place, enough to clinch his first NEXTEL Championship, and the first for Jeff Gordon as a car owner, winning four titles under the Winston Cup banner as a driver for Rick Hendrick.'

aS' Iowa Highway 210 (Iowa 210) is an eastwest highway in central Iowa covering 34.86 miles (56.10km). It begins at IowaHighway141 south of Woodward and ends at U.S. Route 65 south of Collins. The routing closely parallels and crosses the former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad grade. Passing through mostly rural farmland, Iowa 210 serves as a collector for two central Iowa freeways  Interstate 35 and Iowa 141. Iowa Highway 210 begins at an interchange with Iowa Highway 141 south of Woodward. Just north of Woodward, and immediately after crossing into Boone County, Iowa 210 turns east at the entrance to the Woodward Resource Center. The route crosses the meandering Des Moines River next to the former Milwaukee Road high bridge[2] before entering Madrid. At Madrid, Iowa 210 shares one block, 0.078 miles (410ft; 126m), with Iowa Highway 17. Iowa Highway 210 continues east and enters Story County and the town of Slater. South of Huxley, Iowa 210 intersects U.S. Route 69. East of US 69, Iowa 210 serves as a collector route to Interstate 35, serving, on average, over 4500 vehicles per day.[3] East of Interstate 35, Iowa Highway 210 primarily serves local traffic.[3] Iowa 210 serves Cambridge via county highways and Maxwell directly. South of Collins, Iowa 210 ends at U.S. Route 65. Iowa Highway 210 was designated on 8 January 1938 as a double-spur route between Slater and Maxwell.[4] It was extended eastward to US 65 and westward to Iowa 141, absorbing Iowa 89,[2] in November 1980.[4] In 1997, when Iowa 141 was upgraded to an expressway, the southern end of Iowa 210 was extended approximately 500 feet (150m).

It is located approximately 2 miles (3km) east of the town centre.[1] Between 1920 and the Second World War, Carlyon Bay was the site of the New Cornish Riviera Lido and large sports facilities. After the war it became known as the Cornish Leisure World. The Cornwall Coliseum hosted exhibitions, tennis tournaments and many concerts by leading musicians, but lost its importance with the opening of the Plymouth Pavilions in 1991.[2] The original 1990 planning permission for redevelopment into 500 homes was at first not realised, the main obstacle being the need for better sea defences.[3] Nevertheless, the site fell into disrepair.[2] In July 2011, Cornwall Council approved a new planning application for 500 luxury apartments and associated facilities.[4] The private developers (Ampersand and Commercial Estates Group) are planning to begin work on the new sea defences in late 2011 and on the apartments in spring 2012.[5] Carlyon Bay is surrounded by low cliffs and is divided into three areas: Crinnis, Shorthorn and Polgaver. Much of the sand on the beach is actually waste material from the china clay industry known as "stent". Cornwall Wildlife Trust has identified Shorthorn Beach (the middle beach of the three) as a site of national importance. The area surrounding the bay was a centre of the mining industry and is now a golf course. The South West Coast Path runs along the cliff top and across the golf course. The Cliff Head Hotel was established in 1934. In 1979 a scene for the film Dracula was filmed at Carlyon Bay[6] and in 1986 the music video for Is This Love? by Alison Moyet was filmed on the beach.'

aS'In video, luma represents the brightness in an image (the "black-and-white" or achromatic portion of the image). Luma is typically paired with chrominance. Luma represents the achromatic image, while the chroma components represent the color information. Converting R\'G\'B\' sources (such as the output of a 3CCD camera) into luma and chroma allows for chroma subsampling: because human vision has finer spatial sensitivity to luminance ("black and white") differences than chromatic differences, video systems can store chromatic information at lower resolution, optimizing perceived detail at a particular bandwidth. Luma is the weighted sum of gamma-compressed R\'G\'B\' components of a color video  the prime symbols (\') denote gamma-compression. The word was proposed to prevent confusion between luma as implemented in video engineering and luminance as used in color science (i.e. as defined by CIE). Luminance is formed as a weighted sum of linear RGB components, not gamma-compressed ones. Even so, luma is erroneously called luminance.[1] SMPTE EG 28 recommends the symbol Y\' to denote luma and the symbol Y to denote luminance.[2] While luma is more often encountered, (photometric) luminance is sometimes used in video engineering when referring to the brightness of a monitor. The formula used to calculate luminance uses coefficients based on the CIE color matching functions and the relevant standard chromaticities of red, green, and blue (e.g., the original NTSC primaries, SMPTE C, or Rec. 709). For the Rec. 709 primaries, the linear combination, based on pure colorimetric considerations and the definition of luminance is: The formula used to calculate luma in the Rec. 709 spec arbitrarily also uses these same coefficients, but with gamma-compressed components: For digital formats following CCIR 601 (i.e. most digital standard definition formats), luma is calculated with the formula Y\' = 0.299 R\' + 0.587 G\' + 0.114 B\'. Formats following ITU-R Recommendation BT. 709 use the formula Y\' = 0.2126 R\' + 0.7152 G\' + 0.0722 B\'. Modern HDTV systems use the 709 coefficients, while transitional 1035i HDTV formats may use the SMPTE 240M coefficients (Y\' = 0.212 R\' + 0.701 G\' + 0.087 B\'). These coefficients correspond to the SMPTE RP 145 primaries (also known as "SMPTE C") in use at the time the standard was created.[3] The change in the luma coefficients is to provide the "theoretically correct" coefficients that reflect the corresponding standard chromaticities (\'colors\') of the primaries red, green, and blue. However, there is some controversy regarding this decision.[4] The difference in luma coefficients requires that component signals must be converted between Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 to provide accurate colors. In consumer equipment, the matrix required to perform this conversion may be omitted (to reduce cost), resulting in inaccurate color. As well, the Rec. 709 luma coefficients may not necessarily provide better performance. Because of the difference between luma and luminance, luma does not exactly represent the luminance in an image. As a result, errors in chroma can affect luminance. Luma alone does not perfectly represent luminance; accurate luminance requires both accurate luma and chroma. Hence, errors in chroma "bleed" into the luminance of an image. Due to the widespread usage of chroma subsampling, \'errors\' in chroma typically occur when it is lowered in resolution/bandwidth. This lowered bandwidth, coupled with high frequency chroma components, can cause visible errors in luminance. An example of a high frequency chroma component would be the line between the green and magenta bars of the SMPTE color bars test pattern. Error in luminance can be seen as a dark band that occurs in this area.[5]'

aS'Les Parents terribles is a 1948 film adaptation directed by Jean Cocteau from his own stage play Les Parents terribles. Cocteau used the same cast who had appeared in a successful stage revival of the play in Paris in 1946. The film has sometimes been known by the English title The Storm Within. Cocteau\'s stage play Les Parents terribles was first produced in Paris in 1938, but its run suffered from a number of disruptions, first from censorship and then the outbreak of war. In 1946 it was revived in a production which brought together several of the actors for whom Cocteau had originally conceived their roles, notably Yvonne de Bray, Gabrielle Dorziat, and Jean Marais. Cocteau said that he wanted to film his play for three reasons. "First, to record the performances of incomparable actors; second, mingle with them myself and look them full in the face instead of seeing them at a distance on the stage. I wanted to put my eye to the keyhole and surprise them with a telescopic lens."[1] In a rambling apartment a middle-aged couple, Yvonne and Georges, live with their 22-year old son Michel and Yvonne\'s spinster sister Lonie ("tante Lo"), who has also been in love with Georges. Yvonne is a reclusive semi-invalid, dependent on her insulin treatment, and intensely possessive of her son (who returns her immoderate affection and calls her "Sophie"); Georges distractedly pursues his eccentric inventions; it is left to Lo to preserve such order as she can in their life and their apartment, which she describes as a "gypsy caravan" ("la roulotte"). When Michel announces that he is in love with a girl, Madeleine, whom he wishes to introduce to them, his parents are immediately hostile and seek to forbid the relationship, reducing Michel to despair. Georges realises that Madeleine is the same woman who has been his own mistress in recent months, and he confesses all to Lo, who devises a plan to extricate father and son by forcing Madeleine into silent surrender of them both. The family visit Madeleine in her apartment where they are impressed by her modest and well-disciplined manner. Michel\'s initial joy at this apparent reconciliation turns to despair as Madeleine is blackmailed into rejecting him by Georges\'s secret threats. Yvonne consoles her son with satisfaction as they return home. Lo however is appalled by the cruelty and selfishness of what has been done and decides to support Madeleine. The next day Lo persuades Georges, and then the more reluctant Yvonne, that the only way to rescue the inconsolable Michel is to allow him to marry Madeleine. Michel and Madeleine are joyfully reunited, but Yvonne is unnoticed as she slips away and poisons herself. When the others realise what she has done, it is too late to save her. A new order is established in the "roulotte". Cocteau made the important decision that his film would be strictly faithful to the writing of the play and that he would not open it out from its prescribed settings (as he had done in his previous adaptation, L\'Aigle  deux ttes). He wrote no additional dialogue for the film, but substantially pruned the stage text, making the drama more concentrated.[2] He did however reinvent the staging of the play for the camera, employing frequent boldly framed close-ups of his actors, and he made full use of a mobile camera to roam through the rooms of the apartment, emphasising the claustrophobic atmosphere of the setting.[3] The translation from theatre to screen was a challenge which Cocteau relished: he wrote, "What is exciting about the cinema is that there is no syntax. You have to invent it as and when problems arise. What freedom for the artist and what results one can obtain!".[4] Another significant contribution to the atmosphere of the film was the art direction by Christian Brard which filled the spaces of the apartment with objects and dcor - awkward heavy furniture, piles of trinkets and ornaments, pictures crooked on the walls, unmade beds, and dust - which described the way in which the characters lived.[2] Cocteau refuted however the suggestion of some critics that this was a realist film, pointing out that he had never known any family like the one portrayed, and insisting that it was "painting of the most imaginative kind".[5] Filming took place between 28 April and 3 July 1948 at the Studio Francur. Cocteau\'s assistant director was Raymond Leboursier, who was joined by Claude Pinoteau (uncredited). At the time of shooting the final shot (where one sees the apartment receding into the distance), some insecure tracks for the camera produced a shaky image on the film. Rather than reshoot the scene, Cocteau made a virtue of the problem by adding the sound of carriage wheels on the soundtrack together with some words (spoken by himself) to suggest a deliberate effect:[6] "And the caravan continued on its way. The gypsies do not stop." ["Et la roulotte continuait sa route. Les romanichels ne s\'arrtent pas."] When the film was first shown in France in December 1948, the critical reception of it was overwhelmingly favourable and Cocteau was repeatedly congratulated on having produced an original piece of cinema out of a work of the theatre: for example, "It is what one may rightly call pure cinema... The correspondence between image and text has never been so complete, so convincing".[7] Andr Bazin wrote a detailed review of the film in which he took up the idea of "pure cinema" and tried to analyse how Cocteau had succeeded in creating it out of the most uncinematic material imaginable. Bazin highlights three features which assist this transition. Firstly the confidence and harmony of the actors, who have previously played their roles together many times on stage and are able to inhabit their characters as if by second nature, allow them to maintain an intensity of performance despite the fragmentation of the film-making process. Secondly, Cocteau shows unusual freedom in his choice of camera positions and movements, seldom resorting to the conventional means of filming dialogue with reverse angle shots, and introducing close-ups and long shots with a sureness of touch that never disrupts the movement of the scene; the spectator is always placed in the position of a witness to the action (as in the theatre), rather than a participant, and even that of a voyeur, given the intimacy of the camera\'s gaze. Thirdly, Bazin notes the psychological subtlety with which Cocteau chooses his camera positions to match the responses of his \'ideal spectator\'. He cites an example of the shot in which Michel tells Yvonne about the girl he loves, his face placed above hers and both facing the audience, just as they had done in the theatre; but in the film Cocteau uses a close-up which shows only the eyes of Yvonne below and the speaking mouth of Michel above, concentrating the image for the greatest emotional impact. In all of these aspects, the theatricality of the play is preserved but intensified through the medium of film.[8] Cocteau himself came to regard Les Parents terribles as his best film, at least from a technical point of view.[9] This opinion has frequently been endorsed by later critics and historians of cinema.[10][11]'

aS"Address to the Deil is a poem by Scottish poet Robert Burns. It was written in Mossgiel in 1785 and published in the Kilmarnock volume in 1786. It is generally considered one of Burns' best poems.[citation needed] The poem was written as a humorous portrayal of the Devil and the pulpit oratory of the Presbyterian Church. The poem starts by quoting from Milton's Paradise Lost as a contrast with the first two lines of the poem itself: These lines are also a parody of a couplet in Alexander Pope's satire The Dunciad. The poem was written in a Habbie stanza with the stanza six lines long and the rhyme aaabab. Burns used a similar stanza in Death and Doctor Hornbrook. The poem is also skeptical of the Devil's existence and of his intentions to punish sinners for all eternity as in the stanza. This contrasts with the views contained in works such as Paradise Lost and the preachings of the Church."

aS'Century is a New York Times best-selling novel, written by Fred Mustard Stewart and published in 1981. The story follows four generations of an Italian-American family with settings in both America and Italy. Most of the events that take place in the novel, take place in actual American and Italian history. Readers are witnesses to the rise of Benito Mussolini, the Prohibition period, Black Tuesday, World War I, World War II, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Holocaust, and the gradual formation of the motion picture industry in Hollywood. The novel spent six weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list.[1] Seven-year-old Princess Syliva Maria Pia Angelica Toscanelli is called to the Mother Superior\'s office. She is told that her father, Prince Filiberto was killed in battle, making the princess an orphan. Private Augusts Dexter is on his way back from Savannah, Georgia, after delivering confidential papers from General Sherman when he decides to spend the night at a burned plantation house, in order to rest and loot the house. An old slave, offers him his mistress\'s jewels for fifty dollars. Augusts gives him thirty dollars and his father\'s gold watch. He plans to sell the jewellery and use them to fund his plans of building a bank in New York. Alice Dexter, the wife of Augustus, is vacationing in the Villa dell\'Acqua after having struck up a friendship with Princess Sylvia. She meets Vittorio Spada, a servant child, with whom she takes a great liking to. Franco Spada, the older brother of Vittorio, and the gardener of the villa, bribes the local priest with a gold watch. Franco asks the priest to care for Vittorio, in the case of his death. The next morning, Princess Sylvia goes on her daily horse ride, when she encounters what appears to be an unconscious Franco. When she dismounts and attempts to wake him, Franco immediately holds her at gunpoint in the hopes of kidnapping her so that the royal family will give enough money to send him and Vittorio to America. Princess Sylvia laughs at him, and demands that he help her to mount her horse. Afterwards, she invites him to meet her at the library where she begins to teach him how to read and write. She is later warned by Alice of the suspicions that could possibly arise from her teaching Franco, particularly the suspicions of her husband. Princess Sylvia ignores it, and continues to teach him. Prince Giancarlo returns home after a bomb scare. He meets with a Mafia man to arrange for Franco\'s removal from his wife\'s presence. One night Franco is awoken and arrested for the rape and murder of a local girl. He is later arraigned and given a life-sentence. Princess Sylvia makes it her life goal to fight for his release, knowing that Prince Giancarlo, was likely behind the arrest. She writes to Alice explaining her woes and the fear for Vittorio\'s future. Alice, who is unable to produce children, decides to have Vittorio sent to America to become her son, against the wishes of Augustus. Franco is later transferred to the island of San Stefano to live out the remainder of his life sentence with hard labor. He becomes chained to Fillipo Pieri with whom he immediately bonds to. Vittorio is now known as Victor Dexter, the legally adopted son of Alice and Augustus Dexter. Augustus continues to treat him as a nuisance but slowly shows signs of warmth. He is called into Augustus\'s office to be pressured into attending the family Christmas party. Victor decides to ask Lucille Elliot, his cousin, but she is already attending with her boyfriend. At the Christmas party, he dances enthusiastically with an unattractive girl, with whom he was tricked into dancing with by his cousin Rodney. Lucille takes notice and asks Victor to dance with her. Shortly after, a drunk Rodney and Lucille\'s boyfriend gang up on Victor leading to a public fight. Afterwards, Victor leaves and travels to Little Italy. A prostitute approaches him, and he decides to give in to his sexual urges for the first time. The next day Victor returns home to inform Alice and Augustus that he is moving out, and living with an Italian family. He meets Gianni, the family\'s son, with whom he is asked to teach English to. When Victor returns to work at the bank, Augustus calls him to his office, to question the loan application of an Italian grocer. Victor informs him that he recommended the grocer to apply at their bank. The two argue after Augustus chooses to reject it based on his racist hatred of Italians. After the argument, Augustus approves the loan. A celebration with the local Italians ensues, and Gianni asks Victor to accompany him to a "club". The club turns out to be a gang led by Little Vinnie. Victor rejects the invitation to join and leaves. Alice is becoming weak due to tuberculosis. She celebrates her thirty-sixth birthday with her family. Victor meets up with Lucille and tells her that he loves her, and to marry him. She decides to date him. Upon their first date, he discovers that Howard Cantrell, the genial cashier of the bank is embezzling money. After confronting him, Howard runs and away and drowns himself. Augustus later praises Victor for his discovery, and finally attempts to connect with him. On his way back home, Victor runs into Gianni, Little Vinnie and their friend Marco. The three are drunk and decide to teach him a lesson. An accident ensues in which Marco is killed. Little Vinnie assures Victor before they leave, that Marco\'s death will not be forgotten. Later, Victor moves back home with Alice and Augustus. He later confesses the accident to Augustus, who accepts it calmly but secretly harbors mixed feelings regarding Victor\'s true nature. Alice dies ten days later from her illness. In Italy, Franco writes in his diary that Fillipo has died due to a heat stroke coupled with twelve years of backbreaking work. He plans to escape the prison and prepares to do so, only to find that the newly widowed Princess Sylvia has managed to have him pardoned by the King, and released. She brings him back to the villa where he cleans and is offered the services of a prostitute. However, Franco rejects her, and confesses his love for the princess, who has secretly harbored feelings for Franco as well. The two becomes lovers, and he decides with her support to create a socialist newspaper, which eventually becomes successful. The eleven years after Alice\'s death, were happy ones for Victor. He married Lucille and fathered three children with her. Also during that period, he and Augustus shared a greater relationship, before Augustus\'s death from a cerebral hemorrhage. Three days after Augustus\'s funeral, the will was read. Victor learned that he had been left a large amount of money. Yet, the controlling shares of the Dexter Bank were left to Lucille. Eventually, Victor came to understand that it was Augustus\'s way of conveying to Victor, that he didn\'t completely trust him, after the night he learned that Victor killed a man. With Victor as the new president of the Dexter Bank, he immediately initiates great changes by reaching out to new classes of depositors  primarily the urban poor and immigrants. Little Vinnie learns of this change, and meets up with Victor at the bank to blackmail him into giving him a hundred thousand dollar loan. Victor fears that Little Vinnie will tell the media about Marco\'s death. He arranges to speak with the uncle of Julia Lombardini, his new secretary, due to his insights on Little Vinnie\'s criminal activities. Later, Little Vinnie and Gianni are arrested on charges of robbery. The two had been manipulated into committing a crime that Victor and an undercover police officer had planned. Lucille decides to use some of the income from the bank stock to build a mansion for the family. She hires Archie Winstead, an architect, to aid in the design and construction. Victor worries that she will drive the bank into bankruptcy with her spending. Tensions arise when she informs Victor that he can do nothing to stop her plans for the building, nor her plans for moving upwards in the social hierarchy. Eventually, Victor asks Lucille to sell him her stock. She refuses, because she enjoys the new power that she holds over him. On the day that Victor receives news of Little Vinnie\'s arrest, Lucille asks him to make love to her. He rejects her, making her realize that her once compliant husband is rebelling. During Christmas, Lucille is in London buying furniture for their home. Victor is invited to Julia\'s home to spend Christmas with her family. After dinner he and Julia walk along the beach, when he confesses that he is falling in love with her. She accepts his kiss before pushing him away and insisting that she be his secretary, rather than his mistress. Back at Julia\'s home, Victor asks her uncle who owns a local Italian newspaper for help in forcing Lucille to sell her stock. With the newspaper, they ask the Italian community to deposit their money into the Dexter Bank. Lucille returns home ecstatic with the deposits and increases in stock. She buys a new dress, only to discover that the new Italian depositors, are withdrawing their money. Lucille quickly realizes that Victor had planned the sudden deposits to force her to sell. They argue with Victor telling her that she has forced him into doing this for fear that she will sell the stock out of the family in order to climb the social ladder. She cries and asks Victor if he loves her. He admits that he does not know anymore. Afterwards, she tells him that she will sell the stock to him, leaving Victor to realize by doing so it may have cost him his marriage. Meanwhile, in Italy Franco is now a senator and living with Princess Sylvia and their twin sons. He uses his position to pressure the senate into launching a crusade against the Mafia. Sylvia worries for his safety and asks that he hire a bodyguard. Their son Tony, is under the tutelage of Cardinal dell\'Acqua, in hopes of becoming a priest. The Cardinal presses Tony to encourage his parents to solidify their marriage by marrying. Despite Franco\'s continuous attack on the Church, the couple agree. Later, Tony\'s brother Fausto pressures him into coming along to La Rosina, the local brothel. Although Tony is initially resistant he agrees. He sleep with a woman for the first time. Later, he angrily admits to Fausto that he enjoyed it. The next day he informs his mother that he is going to be a priest. Back in America, Julia is now Victor\'s mistress despite her desire to be anything but. She argues with him to divorce Lucille. Victor continually insists that the timing is wrong despite his desire to be with her as well. Eventually, Victor and his family are aboard a ship to Italy where they have been invited to attend Franco and Sylvia\'s wedding. It will be the first time Victor has returned to Italy in thirty years. Yet, he cannot be happy while Julia is upset at him. That night, Victor and Lucille engage in an argument before Victor asks her for a divorce. She refuses and informs him that he is not rich enough for her to divorce him yet. On the third day of traveling, they reach Rome where Victor tearfully reunites with Franco. The two converse that night with Franco telling Victor, that it is apparent he is unhappily married. Franco and Sylvia are later married by Cardinal dell\'Acqua where a grand celebration takes place afterwards. When the Dexter family returns home, Julia meets with Victor and tells him that while he has been away, she has been dating a wine importer and accepted his proposal in spite of the fact that she does not love him. Victor tells Julia that he has tried to divorce Lucille, but she will not agree. Julia does not relent and admits that she has grown to despise being his mistress. They depart by saying thank you for the last six years shared together. A week later Victor receives a cable from Sylvia informing him that Franco was run over by a car and killed. He retreats into a room to mourn his losses. In Rome, Fausto angrily tells his mother that his father\'s death was no accident. He is certain that the Mafia was involved. He promises to avenge his death. A woman named Elaine Fitzsimmons has approached Victor with the idea of writing a book about his life. He considers it, before inviting her to spend the weekend with his family at their weekend house on Sands Point. Before leaving the office, he meets with Morris David, a director, writer and producer of films. Morris asks Victor to aid him in financing his next film. Victor agrees under the condition of seeing Morris\'s other works. That night, he attends the movies and watches Morris\'s The Undressed Salad. He decides to finance it. Drew Dexter and his friends steal a speedboat with the intentions of returning it. They are caught and end up in jail for the night. Victor decides to have him work with the Sand Point road crews in order to learn his lesson. In the meantime, Barbara Dexter meets Morris who has come into Sand Points attempting to meet with her father. They find themselves amused by the differences in their personalities as they ride back to her home. Before leaving he tells her to contact him if she finds any good books that could possibly be made into films. Elaine has tea with Lucille who has been hiring her to seduce Victor. Lucille hopes that by entrapping Victor, she will receive a generous divorce settlement. However, Elaine finds herself turned off by Lucille\'s cold nature. She confides in Victor and the two become lovers. Unbeknownst to the two, Lucille is all too aware of their relationship and sends two photographers to their rooms. When he returns home, she triumphantly announces what she intends to reap from their divorce settlement. Before he leaves, she is startled to hear him say that he feels sorry for what he knows she will become. As he walks out she finds herself wishing he would come back. In Italy, Lieutenant Fausto and his men are captured during the Battle of Caporetto. The German captain who has caught him allows him to escape home where Princess Sylvia has transformed the palazzo into a hospital for wounded soldiers. Fausto returns and takes note of a pretty nurse named Nanda Montecatini. He asks his mother to introduce them. Yet, Fausto is not the only one to notice Nanda. Tony struggles with his role as a priest and his strong desires for Nanda. During Fausot\'s first date with Nanda, he mistakenly falls prey to the rumor that all Jewish girls are easy. He attempts to force Nanda to sleep with him. She knees him in the groin. He apologizes and the two agree to see each other later. Meanwhile, Tony confesses to Cardinal dell\'Acqua his lustful thoughts of Nanda. Cardinal dell\'Acqua insists that Tony must purge himself of such thoughts. Later, Fausto is traveling a taxi to rejoin his commanding officer. They are forced to stop due to a crow of people gathered around Benito Mussolini. He steps outside and finds himself entranced by the speaker. Morris David and Barbara Dexter are now married and living in Hollywood, where David has become a successful comedic film producer. They hold a great celebration filled with various Hollywood celebrities for their open house. Also in attendance, is the newly married Lucille, her young husband Archibald Pembroke and Lorna Dexter. During the party, Morris makes an announcement that he intends to create Russia, the most expensive dramatic film of its time, in order to document the suffering of the Russian Jews. While at the party Lorna meets Carl Maria von Gersdorff, a concert pianist. Though engaged, she finds herself attracted to him. While filming Russia, numerous difficulties, accidents and upsets cause the film to be delayed and even more costly. Barbara decides to fund the film so long as Morris changes the genre to comedy, which he ultimately agrees to after realizing that all of the accidents and dramatic effects have essentially created a comedy. Back in New York, Lorna visits Victor to inform him that she is marrying Carl. Although happy for her, Victor feels even lonelier knowing that his last daughter is now leaving him. On the night of the premiere of Russia, Morris and Barbara return home. The film is well received by fans and critics alike. However, as Morris professes his love for Barbara\'s faith in him, she slaps him. Morris eventually learns that Barbara had discovered that he had been sleeping with Laura Kaye, the female lead in the film. Soon after, Morris manages to charm Barbara into forgiving him. A week after the premiere, Lorna marries Carl. Eight months later they have a baby girl named Gabriella.'

aS"Sirhind is the older and more popular name of Fatehgarh Sahib. It is situated on the Delhi to Lahore Highway. It has a population of about 60,852. It is now a district headquarters in the state of Punjab; the name of the district is Fatehgarh Sahib. The antiquity of the city is traceable to the beginning of the Christian era. It was a military outpost of Prithviraj Chauhan against Muhammad Ghori. In 1192 it became a part of Ghauri Sultanate after the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan. It was refounded by Emperor Firuz Shah Tughlaq in 1361 AD at the behest of Sayyid Jalaluddin Bukhari, the spiritual guide of that King. He made it a new pargana by dividing the old fief of Samana. Firuz Shah dug a canal from the Sutlej. It was an important stronghold of Delhi Sultanate. In 1415 Khizr Khan the first Sayyid ruler of Delhi, nominated his son Malik Mubarak as a governor of Sirhind. in 1420 Khizr khan defeated insurgent Sarang Khan at Sirhind. In 1451 here, Bahlul Khan Lodhi assumed the title of Sultan under the governorship of Malik Sultan Shah Lodhi. However it reached the zenith of its glory under the Mughal Empire in the seventeenth century. This city was a home of sixteenth-century saint Ahmad Sirhindi, popularly known as Mujadid Alif Sani which means 'Revivor of the Faith in the Second Millennium'. The mausoleum of this saint is still there. Under Akbar it had turned the highest yielding sarkar. Under Sirhind sarkar there were 28 parganas. Due to its prosperity during the Mughal Empire it was known as Sirhind Bvani which means Sirhind Fifty-two because it yielded a revenue of 52 lakh Rs, i.e. 5 million 20 thousand Rs per year. Emperor Shah Jahan built a famous garden known as Aam khas Bagh. Baba Banda Singh Bahadur and his Sikh army in 1710 destroyed the city of Sirhind completely,and Wazir Khan the governor, was killed. The Sikhs occupied Sirhind and made Bhai Baj Singh the governor. Adina Beg Khan, along with Sikhs was already in revolt with Ahmad Shah Abdali who had invaded Punjab multiple times. He asked Marathas for help, On 7 March, 1758, Marathas at that time were the paramount power in India, Maratha general, Raghunathrao had encamped at Rajpura where he received Adina Beg Khans envoys, and was informed that the latter, accompanied by Sikh militias, belonging to the bands of Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Ala Singh of Patiala had closed upon Sirhind from the other side of Satluj. A concerted attack on the fort of Sirhind was made by the Marathas on 8 March 1758. Ahmad Samad Khan, with his 10,000 Afghan troops, held out for about two weeks before his capitulation on 21 March. After the victory, the town was thoroughly sacked by the victors. After defeating the Afghan-Rohilla forces, the Marathas pursued the Afghans into the Punjab. Under the orders of the faujdar, Nawab Wazir Khan, Guru Gobind Singh`s two younger sons, aged nine and seven, were cruelly done to death. According to Sikh tradition, they were enclosed alive in a wall in Sirhind and executed as the masonry rose up to their necks. Sirhind was for this reason the accurst city in the eyes of the Sikhs. Mobilized under the flag of Banda Singh Bahadur after the death of Guru Gobind Singh in November 1708, they made a fierce attack upon Sirhind. The Mughal army was routed and Wazir Khan killed in the battle of Chappar Chiri fought on 12 May 1710. Sirhind was occupied by the Sikhs two days later, and Bhai Baj Singh was appointed governor. The town was, however, taken again by the imperial forces. The booty was donated for the repair and reconstruction of the sacred shrines at Amritsar demolished by Ahmad Shah. The territories of the Sirhind sarkar were divided among the leaders of the Dal Khalsa, but no one was willing to take the town of Sirhind where Guru Gobind Singh`s younger sons were subjected to a cruel fate. By a unanimous will it was made over to Buddha Singh, descendant of Bhai Bhagatu, who soon after (2 August 1764) transferred possession to Sardar Ala Singh, founder of the Patiala family. Sirhind thereafter remained part of the Patiala territory until the state lapsed in 1948. Maharaja Karam Singh of Patiala (181345) had gurdwaras constructed in Sirhind in memory of the young martyrs and their grandmother, Mata Gujari. He changed the name of the nizamat or district from Sirhind to Fatehgarh Sahib, after the name of the principal gurdwara. Besides the Sikh shrines, Sirhind has an important Muslim monument Rauza Sharif Mujjadid Alf Sani, the mausoleum of Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi (1569-1624),the fundamentalist leader of the orthodox; Naqshbandi school of Sufism. There are a number of other tombs in the compound mostly of the members of Shaikh Ahmad`s house."

It is regarded as one of the most scenic roads in New Zealand, and with a peak elevation of 940m, also one of the country\'s highest.[1] However, the "Milford Road" part is also one of the more dangerous public roads in New Zealand, with injury crash rates around 65% higher than the rest of New Zealand\'s network, and a fatality crash rate of almost twice average (per vehicle kilometre travelled),[2] making it the third most dangerous section of New Zealand\'s State Highway network (as of 2008).[3] The alignment road was first surveyed in 1890 by London-born engineer Robert Holmes, who later became the Engineer-in-Chief of the Public Works Department. Holmes initially preferred a route starting at Lake Wakatipu and running northwest, but the decision was instead made to start from Te Anau.[1] However, the project then languished in planning for 40 years, possibly because in 1889 road building had been removed from the brief of the Public Works Department, and only reinstated with much more limited authority in 1909.[1] It took until 1935, to construct a rough road to the entrance of what would become Homer Tunnel.[1] As of 2010, this is the route State Highway 94 takes. In Gore, SH 94 begins as Hokonui Drive and passes through the northern parts of Gore. Outside of Gore, the highway changes name to Waimea Highway and passes to the north of the Hokonui Hills, a place historically known for illicit moonshine distilling. On the other side of the hills lies Mandeville. The road then veers right and bisects the Waimea Plains to pass through the settlements of Riversdale (where the road names changes to Newcastle Street and then Lumsden Riversdale Highway once leaving the town) and Balfour. The road proceeds in a northwesterly direction to arrive in Lumsden (where it changes name to Flora Road). From Lumsden, as Flora Road and Five Rivers Lumsden Highway, SH 94 merges with SH 6 and runs concurrently with SH 6 towards Queenstown for 2.5 kilometres between the Oreti River and the hills to the east before turning left to cross the river and back onto the plains as Mossburn Lumsden Highway. The road runs for a further 20km towards Mossburn, the self-proclaimed deer capital of New Zealand (name change to Devon Street). Tourist traffic from Queenstown turn onto SH 94 here from SH 97. Beyond Mossburn, the road changes name to Te Anau Mossburn Highway, and runs underneath a terrace carved by the Oreti River to the north before passing through more arable farmland and the turnoff to go to Mavora Lakes, one of the locations used in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. After the turnoff, the road heads into the hills and passes through undulating tussocklands and valleys before emerging back onto the plains at The Key. From The Key, the road proceeds on a more-or-less north-westerly direction across the plains before arriving at the lakeside resort of Te Anau. In Te Anau, the road changes name to Luxmore Drive as it proceeds towards the town centre. Once there, the road swings to the right and becomes Milford Road, once outside the town limits the road changes name to Te Anau Milford Highway. The road then hugs the shoreline of Lake Te Anau for about 29km until it reaches Te Anau Downs. From Te Anau Downs, the road veers right and enters the Eglinton Valley. The road then runs parallel to the right side of the Eglinton River for 33km while it passes through Knobs Flat. At Cascade Creek, the road emerges onto the shorelines of Lake Gunn and Lake Fergus. The road then passes through a saddle and emerges at the upper section of the Hollyford Valley. After Hollyford, the road veers to the west and rises steadily along the valley to its highest point at the Homer Tunnel. At 1270 metres long it is the second-longest road tunnel in New Zealand (after the Lyttelton road tunnel). The road then emerges at the head of the Cleddau Valley and the road spends its last 16 kilometres descending along the valley to Milford Sound. The Milford Road section began in 1926 when a local Station Owner, started making his own road from Te Anau Downs Harbour south to the Te Anau Hotel, starting a project which turned into the most scenic highway in New Zealand including iconic landmarks the Mirror Lakes, the Avenue of Disappearing Mountain, Lake Gunn, the Key Summit, Mount Christina, Mount Talbot, the Homer Tunnel, The Chasm, Mount Tutoko and Mitre Peak. Before the sealing of the road in the 1980s it was treated as a day\'s adventure from the township of Te Anau and Milford Sound the climax of the journey. Modern marketing and faster buses have made Milford Sound a destination from Queenstown involving 8 hours of bus transit, a round trip with few stops. This route is part of the Te Wai Pounamu Wilderness Area. The Eglinton Mountains above Lake Gunn were used as a location in the Peter Jackson movie The Fellowship of the Ring where the actors walk along a mountain path with the Key Summit evident in the distance. The mountains here were also used in the Fellowship of the Ring introduction to represent the Misty Mountains. Emily Peak on the Routeburn Track can also be seen in this movie, as well as the Mavora Lakes near Mossburn. Ironically, Peter Jackson picked an area that once contained New Zealand\'s only place names from J. R. R. Tolkien that were removed from the official maps in the 1980s, as they were deemed inappropriate for this region.[4] There are many places of Local History not signposted by Transit New Zealand, such as the Cleddau Horse Bridge, the Hollyford Hydro Powerstation remains, the Old Homer Tunnel construction village site, however Transit New Zealand has kept the historic White Mile Posts that are a feature of the early days of the Milford Road Construction. The Department of Conservation has kept up the Latitude 45 South Marker but has abandoned the Avenue of the Disappearing Mountain to history as the avenue of trees beside the Road has become overgrown. Outside of the Milford Road, Mandeville is the site of the Croydon Aircraft Company Link, and the local aerodrome is home to several rare vintage aircraft. Mossburn is the closest settlement to the Mount White Wind Farm which at full capacity can power almost all the entire Southland region. The Oreti, Mataura and Waiau Rivers that dominate the flatter regions of SH 94 between Gore and Te Anau are popular fishing spots for brown trout. Care should be taken while fishing to prevent the spread of Didymosphenia geminata.[5] Tourists to Milford Sound arrive mainly via coach over the length of SH 94 from Mossburn, a predominantly high mountain road which is prone to avalanches in winter. The road was only opened in 1953, after the Homer Tunnel was finished, after almost 20 years of intermittent work. The road is one of the more dangerous public roads in New Zealand, with injury crash rates around 65% higher than the rest of New Zealand\'s network, and a fatality crash rate of almost twice average (per vehicle kilometre travelled),[2] making it the third most dangerous section of New Zealand\'s State Highway network (as of 2008).[3] Stopping is prohibited on long stretches due to rock or snow avalanche dangers, and the road is often closed in winter, with the carrying of snow chains mandatory during snow conditions. Helicopters are used during winter to drop explosives onto snow buildup zones above the road in order to cause controlled avalanches. However this does not eliminate the danger that road traffic may be hit by an uncontrolled event, especially in the area of the Homer Tunnel portals.[2] There are no petrol stations on the length of the road from Te Anau to Milford Sound, meaning that vehicles need to take enough fuel for a return trip. All of this does not discourage up to 50 coaches and hundreds of private cars daily from making the 546km trip from the nearest city Invercargill, and the 572km trip from popular tourist destination Queenstown. Almost 60% of tourists travel via coach, which is regarded as being safer than attempting the road on your own. Avalanches are a winter hazard in the high mountains above the Milford Road and Snow and Ice affect the Road Surface in Winter Months, Transit Signs inform motorists of conditions and a Transit New Zealand check point has been built to make sure road users carry chains for safe passage to Milford Sound. Metal Gates are positioned across the Milford Road In the Hollyford and Cleddau Valleys when the road is closed at times of peak avalanche probability. Due to the nature of the Fiordland Environment, the road can be closed at any time of year from landslips treefalls and washouts. Snow can fall on higher parts of the road any time of the year. However the entire length of SH 94 is susceptible to snowfall during the winter months and care should be taken at any time of the year, especially on the hillier regions between Mossburn and Milford Sound. Flooding can also occur at anytime along the road especially around rivers. Building the Milford Road section of SH 94 has been a classic story of danger, hardship and Kiwi ingenuity in the Depression Years and has been the subject of several books: Harold Andersons 1975 Men of the Milford Road, a detailed account of the project from his perspective as a Public Works Department Paymaster;[6] Wilson Campbells 2000 Novel When stars were brightly shining about a fictional murder in one of the works camps;[7] John Hall-Joness, Milford Sound An Illustrated History of the Sound, the Track and the Road, which covers in detail the history of the road with ample historic photographs;[8] and Amy McDonalds 2005 Below the Mountains, a young girl\'s diary of living on the Milford Road 1935 to 1936.[9] And there are mountain climbing books that cover this area in detail, such as Jack Edes 1988 Mountain Men of Milford[10] and Anita Croziers 1950 Beyond the Southern Lakes.[11]'

aS"RAF Nutts Corner was a Royal Air Force station in County Antrim near Belfast. It was originally a civil airfield, then it became a military airfield and subsequently Northern Ireland's main civil airport until the 1960s. Civil flights began around 1920 from Aldergrove, what is now Belfast International Airport, approximately 6 miles (10km) away from Nutts Corner. The province's first London service began from Nutts Corner in 1934. Civil operations were largely abandoned at both Nutts Corner and RAF Aldergrove during the Second World War. During World War II it was an important RAF Coastal Command station and was also used as a transport hub for aircraft arriving from the United States. No. 120 Squadron RAF operated Consolidated B-24 Liberator maritime patrol bombers from the station from 1941. In 1946 civil air operations were transferred from Belfast Harbour Airport (now the George Best Belfast City Airport) to RAF Nutts Corner due to the longer runways available at that airfield. Other reasons included the limited space available at Belfast for expansion and the danger associated with obstacles such as the cranes around Belfast harbour. Other sites were studied as possible alternative civil airports including RAF Long Kesh and Lisburn. The advantage of choosing Nutts Corner was the large amount of existing hardstanding which was necessary for civil aircraft movements. The former RAF station then became known as Belfast-Nutts Corner Airport. By the end of the 1950s the steep approach necessary for aircraft flying to Nutts Corner was deemed unsuitable. This was due to the location of the airport, close to the Belfast mountains and the obstacles located there, particularly transmitters and aerials. Another factor was the fact that of Nutts Corner's three runways, only one was suitable for modern aircraft. Aldergrove's two runways set at 100 degrees (07-25 and 17-35) to each other made operations possible even if conditions (particularly wind) changed dramatically. The decision to restore civil flights to Aldergrove was taken in July 1959. The move was made official in September 1963 and a month later the present terminal was opened. A section of the A26 Moira Road, running from Nutts Corner Roundabout for approximately 2km, is constructed on one of the old runways. The airfield was used from 1984 to 2004 for events such as the Irish Superbike Championships and Rallycross, but it was restricted due to noise complaints from local residents. A small section of the circuit continues to be used by the Northern Ireland Carting Club (NICA) and the Ulster Karting Club. The site is also used for a weekly market and a model aircraft club is on the site. Coordinates: 543745N 060900W / 54.62917N 6.15000W / 54.62917; -6.15000"

aS"Sir Cyril Taylor GBE, born 14 May 1935 in Leeds, West Yorkshire is a British businessman and social entrepreneur, who founded the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS) in 1964. He served as education reformer and adviser to successive elected British Governments from 1987 to 2007 and founded the City Technology Colleges Trust, subsequently the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT). Taylor later founded Richmond University[1] the American International University in London (formed in 1971), which is accredited in the United States and designated by the Department of Education of HM Government in the UK. Taylor returned to the UK where he was appointed a director of Margaret Thatchers Think Tank, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) and began his political career on the Greater London Council (GLC) as the member for Ruislip-Northwood. Following the abolition of the GLC in 1986, Taylor was called upon by Thatcher, Prime Minister, to assist with the emerging problem of rising youth unemployment.[2]. It was during this time that Taylor founded the City Technology Colleges Trust (CTCT), subsequently the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) where he remained Chairman until 2007. Between 1987 until 2007, Taylor served as Education Adviser to ten successive Secretaries of State for Education on the Specialist Schools and Academies initiative. Taylor was made a Knight Bachelor in the 1989 Birthday Honours for services to education in recognition of the success of the CTC initiative. He was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) for services to education in 2004. Taylor is one few people who have been honoured with two knighthoods. In 1996, Taylor, was appointed by Her Majesty the Queen as High Sheriff of Greater London. Taylor was born 14 May 1935 in Leeds, Yorkshire to parents who were both missionaries in Africa.[citation needed] By the time of Taylor's birth, his father, the Reverend Cyril Eustace Taylor had died leaving his wife Marjorie to bring up Taylor, his brother and four sisters. Taylor was 6 months old when his mother returned to the Congo, together with his brother and one sister. Taylor's formative years were spent in the Belgian Congo now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo where he learnt to speak the local language Kilbua before he learnt to speak English.[citation needed] The outbreak of the Second World War brought Taylor's years in Africa to an end and he returned back to England with his mother in 1941. Six years after returning from Africa, Taylor and his mother moved to London where he was accepted at St Marylebone Grammar School, where he stayed until 1954. Whilst at St Marylebone Grammar, Taylor met Dr Thomas Kingston Derry, a distinguished historian who was to become a major influence on his life.[citation needed] Taylor's mother returned to Yorkshire in 1951 leaving Taylor in London, at his request, where he stayed at the Methodist International House. Taylor was called up for his two years National Service[3] in 1954 where he applied for a commission and was trained as an officer. Taylor was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and was granted a secondment to the King's African Rifles in Kenya during the Mau Mau emergency. He spent eighteen months as the Commander of Number 8 Platoon, C Company, in the 3rd Battalion of the Kings African Rifles.[citation needed] Taylor left the army in March 1956, just prior to going up to Cambridgeand took a teaching job for a term at a private boarding school. In October 1956, Taylor took his place at Trinity Hall, Cambridge[4] to read History. During his time at Cambridge, Taylor became good friends with reporter Mark Tully and Parviz C. Radji, who became the Iranian Ambassador to London and Rome.[citation needed] Taylor's personal tutor was The Reverend Robert Runcie, who became Archbishop of Canterbury and who encouraged and supported Taylor's application to Harvard Business School and who would later recommend Taylor to the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.[citation needed] In 1957 Taylor embarked on his first entrepreneurial adventure at the request of a friend at Cambridge, involving the chartering of a DC6 aeroplane to fly fellow students who wanted to work their summer university break in New York, USA.[citation needed] After working the summer of 1957 in the USA, Taylor ended his trip with a visit to Harvard Business School which influenced his decision to apply to study at Harvard and join the Harvard MBA programme. After graduating from Cambridge with a second-class Honours degree, he was accepted onto the MBA programme by Harvard Business School in September 1959, majoring[5] in Entrepreneurial studies in his final year. After graduation, Taylor was offered a job by Procter & Gamble [6] as a Brand Manager where he worked from 1961 to 1964. Whilst working at Procter & Gamble, Taylor met and later married, French Language teacher, Judy Denman. It was when Taylor helped Denman to organise an educational trip for her pupils to France, to learn French, that he came up with the idea of the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS). Taylor saw there was an untapped market for school trips abroad led by teachers and so spent his two week Procter & Gamble vacation in August 1964 setting up summer study abroad programmes for high school students at universities in European cities.[citation needed] This led to Taylor leaving Procter & Gamble in September 1964 to focus on this new enterprise and together with Roger Walther and Doug Burck, two other Brand Managers from Procter & Gamble, the AIFS[7] was established. Taylor founded the American Institute For Foreign Study (AIFS) in 1964.[8] From 1965 to 1968 the high school programme grew rapidly to nearly 5,000 students with many new summer campuses opening including in England at universities such as St Andrews University, Durham University and even Oxford University and Cambridge University. In 1969, Taylor and his two partners sold AIFS to the National Student Marketing Corporation (NSMC). AIFS went public in the 1970s and Taylor and his partners bought back AIFS from NSMC in 1977. As part of the purchase Camp America[9] was acquired, originally called Rural Britannia. This led to thousands of British and other foreign students travelling to the USA to work as camp counsellors during their summer vacations. Au Pair in America was formed in 1986, and signed into statute by President Clinton. There have since that time been over 90,000 participants. AIFS was floated on the American Stock Exchange in 1986 but was later re-acquired by Taylor and his partner Roger Walther in 1990. In 1993, AIFS was split as Walther wished to concentrate on other business ventures on the West Coast, with the ELS becoming a separate company under Walthers direction. Taylor remains actively involved with the AIFS. Taylor was drawn towards the UK's Conservative Party) politics. Taylor chaired Trinity Halls Conservative Association and he participated in the Cambridge Union Society. In April 1970, Taylor joined the Kensington Conservative Association and was elected deputy chairman of the new combined Kensington and Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency) on the recommendation of the then chairman, George Pole. Taylor helped Conservative Spencer Le Marchant win the Labour held marginal High Peak seat in Derbyshire in the 1970 General Election. The experiences of the Derbyshire campaign helped him to become the Conservatives choice to contest the Huddersfield East seat in 1973. Taylor lost his seat to Labour who regained power in 1974, but as Harold Wilson did not have a working majority in parliament, Taylor called another election for October 1974. He had the opportunity to stand for another marginal seat in Keighley. However, Taylor wanted was a safer seat near to London that would work well with his professional career and also to fit with his family life and so he resigned his candidature.[citation needed] Taylor began to look at other ways to get to Westminster and to serve in a public capacity. In 1977 he was given the opportunity to stand as the Greater London Council (GLC) Conservative candidate[10] for Ruislip-Northwood and won a significant victory. From 1977 until 1986, Taylor served as the member of the GLC for Ruislip-Northwood. Sir Horace Cutler, appointed Taylor to be the chairman of the councils Professional and General Services Committee, which supervised the employment of 25,000 GLC staff. During his time at the GLC, Taylor was concerned with getting better value from public spending and wrote a paper called The Elected Members Guide to Reducing Public Expenditure.[citation needed] The Conservatives lost power to Ken Livingston, Labour, in 1981. However, under Ken Livingstons leadership, Margaret Thatcher abolished the GLC in 1986, together with Taylor's role as a Conservative councillor. Taylor did not agree with Margaret Thatchers decision to abolish the GLC and made his views public. Margaret Thatcher referred to Taylor as a wet, which was seen as one of the strongest forms of abuse for a Conservative at the time. However, Margaret Thatcher later called upon Taylor to assist her with the growing youth unemployment problem of the 1980s.[citation needed] In 1986 Taylor was still a director of Margaret Thatchers Think Tank, the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) and regardless of her views on Taylor's opposition to her abolition of the GLC, he was asked to organise an all day[11] CPS conference to discuss the growing youth unemployment issue. It was from this conference that the idea of City Technology College (CTC) was born with the intention of using private sector and state support to set up the colleges to provide free education to children in urban areas, focused on modern technology. The idea was announced by Education Secretary, Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking, at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth October 1986. Taylor was then appointed as special adviser to organise the project and in May 1987 established the City Technology Colleges Trust (CTCT).[12] The Trust gathered together leading figures from both industry and education as sponsors and between 1987 and 1993, 44 million of sponsorship was raised. The CTCT model was expensive for sponsors and seen as controversial by many local authorities and so had to be changed as it was being developed. Taylor suggested an alternative, less expensive option involving converting existing comprehensive schools to technology colleges. There was still an element of industry sponsorship[13], but at 100,000.00 this was a lot less than the 2 million previously required. Government would also provide match industry funding. The new CTCs needed to show how they would raised standards using their new technology specialisms. This new option was strongly supported by the new Prime Minister, John Major who had succeed Margaret Thatcher in 1990. Taylor remained specialist adviser to Kenneth Bakers four Conservative successors: John MacGregor, Baron MacGregor of Pulham Market; Kenneth Clarke; John Patten, Baron Patten and Gillian Shepherd. It was through Gillian Shepherds enthusiasm and support that Taylor met with the Prime Minister John Major to discuss how to include all schools as potential CTCs rather than remain limited to technology colleges who, on hearing the ideas being put forward, backed Taylor's proposals.[14] The Conservatives lost the 1997 General Election to Labour after seventeen years in power. Taylor sought the support of the Labour Government so that his educational reforms [15] through CTCs and the raising of standards in specialist schools could continue. David Blunkett, Secretary of State for Education[16] from 1997 to 2001, supported Taylor's ideas and together with Conor Ryan, who was David Blunketts key adviser on schools, the specialist schools programme continued. In 1997, Labour was re-elected and Taylor was reappointed as specialist adviser by David Blunkett, who was promoted to Home Secretary. Estelle Morris became Education Secretary who was then succeeded by Charles Clarke when she stepped down. Charles Clarke then became Home Secretary and Ruth Kelly took his place as Education Secretary. All supported the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust(SSAT)[17] programme, as it was now known, which had grown rapidly from 245 in 1997 to 700 by 2001 and by 2009 the number stood at over 3,000. Taylor remained at the helm of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) as a special adviser for education from 1987 until 2007 where he served ten Education Secretaries from both Conservative and Labour governments. Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT), formed by Taylor, remains one of the leading charities in the world. Taylor was honoured in 1989 when Lord Baker recommended Taylor be made a Knight Bachelor [18] in the 1989 Birthday Honours for services to education in recognition of the success of the CTC initiative. In 2004, Tony Blair recommended that Taylor be given the honour of Knight Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) for services to education.[19] After the abolition of the GLC in 1996, Taylor was appointed by Her Majesty the Queen as High Sheriff of Greater London for one year. During this time, Taylor's interest in the welfare and education of young people, led him to focus his attention on how to improve the treatment of young offenders as well as looking at how to reduce crime committed by young people. Awarded Honorary citizenship by the Mayor of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, June 2009 for services to education. Taylor is married to Judy Denman, whom he met whilst he was studying in the USA.[citation needed] They have one daughter. Taylor purchased the freehold of a one-acre site, near to his London home, that is Lexham Gardens, Kensington, by auction in 1989.[citation needed] With the assistance of his wife Judy, he redesigned and replanted the garden, saving the garden from the hands of property developers who wanted to build an underground car park under the gardens. In the gardens first summer of 1991, Lexham Gardens was awarded first prize in the All London Garden Squares Competition, competing against entries from 100 other squares.[21] "

It is located north of Blackness Road, bounded by Blackness Road, Balgay Road, Scott Street and Glenagnes Road. "Logie" in placenames derives from the Scottish Gaelic logan or lagan, meaning a hollow. The main feature of the area is the Logie housing estate, built between 1919 and 1920 and designed by James Thompson. The estate was the first public housing estate built in Scotland after the First World War. It was one of the first in Europe to have a district heating scheme, supplied by a boilerhouse that also provided a public wash-house for the surrounding area. Poor insulation of the supply pipes meant that the snow on the pavements melted. The housing consists mostly of three-room (living room and two bedrooms, plus kitchen and bathroom) and two-room (living room and one bedroom, kitchen and bathroom) in blocks of four flats, two upper and two lower, each with its own front door of the type described in England as a "maisonette". As well as communal drying greens, the houses each have a small allotment, although many of these have now been grassed over. The district heating scheme was closed in the late 1970s and individual central heating installed in each house. The estate is divided by a wide tree-lined dual carriageway, Logie Avenue, which was equipped with a view-point at its upper end next to Victoria Park. The estate was designated as an "outstanding" Conservation Area in 1991. The conservation area designation says of the houses that "the facades are enlivened by simple and effective brick detailing. The care taken over the detailing of the garden fences, gates, address plates, railings, steps and paths give the area a wonderful unity which is still intact today." Adjacent to the housing estate, on the corner of Blackness Road and Glenagnes Road, stood Logie secondary school, later Harris Academy Annexe, designed by C.G. Soutar and opened in 1928. This stood on the site of the Logie poorhouse of Liff & Benvie Parish, which was itself opened in April 1864. The school was destroyed by fire in 2001. A new combined site primary school is being built on the site in 2012. This will replace Park Place, and St Joseph\'s primaries. With the new Single Transferable Vote system in place, Bill Campbell (SNP), , Richard McCready (Labour), Vari McDonald (SNP) and Fraser McPherson (Liberal Democrat) all represent the Logie area as part of the West End ward.

aS'In music, Klang (German: sound) is the "chord of nature", so called because it is built from the first five partials of the overtone series[3] (which if built on C produces: CC\'G\'C"E", a C major chord). The Klang is the abstracted referential sonority, the tonic triad, in Riemannian theory, the dualistic music theory of Hugo Riemann.[4] According to Heinrich Schenker, "The musical sonority as it exists in Nature is a triad" [Der Klang in der Natur ist ein Dreiklang][5] ("drei" = three). In addition to explaining why the perfect fifth is a stronger interval than the major or minor third and other intervals, "the disposition of the triad in Nature also explains why the third produces a more engaging effect in the open position of the triad than in the close position."[2]'

aS'30 Rock (season 6)\nList of 30 Rock episodes "The Tuxedo Begins" is the eighth episode of the sixth season of the American television comedy series 30 Rock, and the 111th overall episode of the series. It was directed by John Riggi, and written by Josh Siegal and Dylan Morgan. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on February 16, 2012. Guest stars in this episode include Will Forte and Steve Buscemi. In this episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) considers running for mayor of New York City after he is mugged on his way to work; Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) becomes frustrated by increasing disorderly behaviour on the subway and decides to get in on it by imitating a mentally ill elderly woman to scare people away; and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) consider living normally as a couple as a potential new fetish, but become concerned that they are in fact simply settling down. On her way to work, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is delayed by what she perceives to be the failure of other subway goers to observe basic social norms, which she generalizes to a breakdown of New York society. While she is complaining to Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) about this in a call, his cell phone is stolen at knifepoint in a construction tunnel. Jack responds to his mugging by hiding in his office for days and organizing the wealthy to protect themselves from the apparently angry lower classes. Shortly, Liz comes down with a cold and dons an elderly woman costume from one of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan sketches, but discovers to her amazement that the getup causes people to avoid her on the subway, fearing that she is sick and potentially mentally ill. Liz concludes that society rewards rulebreaking and anti-social behavior, so she escalates her imitation of an insane old woman to get more personal space in her day-to-day errands. Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and her boyfriend Paul (Will Forte) consider that behaving like a normal couple may be a new fetish after the latter falls asleep instead of taking part in an evening of sexual adventure, and embrace their new way of living with gusto. Fearing that he needs to exercise control over the lower classes, Jack considers a run for mayor, but eventually ventures out with the help of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to confront his fear of walking by the site of his mugging. Suddenly, Liz, in full costume, approaches him to borrow money and a startled Jack throws her in a pile of garbage bags. When the crowd reacts positively to his apparent conquest of the old woman that had been terrorizing the subway, both Jack and Liz come to realise that New Yorkers do cheer those that uphold order after all. Finally, Jenna and Paul reach the realisation that their normal behaviour is not a fetish so much as them beginning to settle down, and resolve to take a "sexual walkabout" for three months to make sure they are ready. The relationship between Batman and the Joker is referenced, with Liz\'s anti-social and chaotic behavior reflecting the Joker (made apparent by her crazy-old-woman eye shadow and lipstick applied in a way that parodies the villain in question\'s, as well as her purple coat and green sweater vest) and Jack\'s character reflecting the secluded superhero dressed in a tuxedo. Harsh blue and red lighting works to give some scenes a comic book feel. The episode title, "The Tuxedo Begins," is a reference to the movie Batman Begins while the superhero name, The Tuxedo, references "The Shadow", also played by Alec Baldwin. According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 3.59million households in its original American broadcast.[1] It earned a 1.5 rating/4 share in the 1849 demographic.[1] This means that it was seen by 1.5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. Tina Fey submitted this episode for consideration due to her nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards.'

aS"Anti-capitalist (Turkish: Antikapitalist) was a Trotskyist organisation in Turkey. It was part of the International Socialist Tendency led by the Socialist Workers Party (UK). The antecedents of Antikapitalist can be traced back to 1982 when the origins of the Sosyalist i (today's Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party) were formed. After founding of the Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party in 1997, internal problems emerged and led to a split in the new party in 1998 and a group named i Demokrasisi (Workers Democracy) (D) left the group. The leaderships of the British and Greek SWPs supported different sides in this dispute. Some time later some members of D left to form Antikapitalist. Some small groups left the group; the members left in Antikapitalist was small and unable to organize. The group was abolished in 2010. The few last members of Antikapitalist joined the Equality and Democracy Party (Eitlik ve Demokrasi Partisi, EDP). "

aS"Aerolneas Argentinas (English: Argentine Airlines), formally Aerolneas Argentinas S.A.,[8] is Argentina's largest airline and serves as the country's flag carrier.[6][9][10] Owned in its majority by the Argentine Government,[3] the airline is headquartered in the Torre Bouchard, located in San Nicols, Buenos Aires.[4][8] Aerolneas Argentinas Cargo, domestic airline Austral Lneas Areas, ramp service provider Aerohandling, cargo division JetPaq S.A., and tourism operator Optar S.A. are listed as Aerolneas Argentinas subsidiaries.[11] The airline and its subsidiaries operates from two hubs, both located in Buenos Aires.[1] Operations of domestic and regional flights by the smaller aircraft types in the fleet are concentrated at Aeroparque Jorge Newbery, which also serves as its operating base, whereas Ministro Pistarini International Airport is mainly used for international services,[12] although some regional and few domestic services are operated as well.[13] The company provides free-of-charge transportation to those passengers that need to change from one airport to the other.[14] The carrier became the 18th SkyTeam member in late August2012(2012-08). The history of the airline can be traced back to 1929, when Compagnie Gnrale Aropostale (Aropostale) started airmail operations between Buenos Aires and Asuncin, and it later expanded its network to cities located in the Patagonia.[15] Many Frenchmen pilots flew for this company in its beginnings, with Antoine de Saint-Exupry being among them.[3] Argentine personnel occupied vacant posts left by the Frenchmen as they gradually withdrew from the airline,[15] and shortly after Aropostale's Argentine subsidiary Aeroposta Argentina was formed. In 1947 this airline stepped into a mixed-stock company, in which the Government had a 20% stake and private investors held the balance.[15] As Aeroposta expanded its network southwards and incorporated the Douglas DC-3 into its fleet, other three mixed-stock companies were present at that time: ALFA (Aviacin del Litoral Fluvial Argentino) mainly operated flying boats northwards to the Mesopotamia, FAMA (Flota Area Mercante Argentina) operated overseas services with DC-4s as its mainstay equipment, and ZONDA (Zonas Oeste y Norte de Aerolneas Argentinas) was mainly concerned with operations in the northwest region.[15] As these carriers started being unprofitable, all of them were amalgamated into a single state-owned company on 14 May 1949.[15][16][17] The state holding was officially rebranded as Aerolneas Argentinas-Empresa del Estado, despite it was commonly known as Aerolneas Argentinas, or simply Aerolneas.[18] The four companies comprising the state holding ceased operations on 31 December 1949.[18] Aerolneas Argentinas started operations on its own on 7 December 1950.[19] In February1950(1950-02), almost ten months prior to the start of operations, five new Convairs were already acquired.[20] Key to the growth of the airline in the early years were Alfonso Aliaga Garca, and Dirk Wessel Van Layden a former pilot of the French carrier Aropostale, who was influential in raising flying standards. The DC-3 proved an invaluable asset for Aerolneas Argentinas as for many other airlines worldwide. It enabled the company to fly to domestic destinations that had hitherto been unreachable, and to keep flying the FAMA international network. As early as 1950 the Douglas DC-6 was added to the fleet, and was used to launch a weekly Buenos AiresRio de JaneiroNatalDakarLisbonParisFrankfurt flight in late 1950.[21] Soon afterwards, Douglas DC-4s joined the fleet and services were inaugurated to Santiago de Chile, Lima, Santa Cruz, and So Paulo. By March1953(1953-03), the airline had a route network that was 35,000 miles (56,000km) long, flown with DC-3s, DC-4s, DC-6s, Convair-Liner 240s and Short Sandringhams.[22] The Comet had begun commercial jet services in the 1950s, and the carrier once again set the pace among the South American airlines, when Aerolneas' president A. Cdre. Juan Jos Giraldes persuaded Argentina's President Arturo Frondizi to buy six of them, becoming the first overseas airline in ordering the type.[16][23] Being the first jetliner flown by Aerolneas and named Las Tres Maras, the first of them landed at Ezeiza Airport on 2 March 1959.[24][25][26] With these jets, Aerolneas Argentinas kept a steady growth during the 1960s, opening routes to London, Paris, Rome, and Madrid. The 1960s also saw the incorporation of the Avro 748 short-haul turboprop airliner, that had its maiden flight with the company on 15 February 1962 between Buenos Aires and Punta del Este; Aerolneas was actually the launch customer for this type of aircraft.[18][27] Likewise, the Caravelle first flew for the carrier on the Buenos AiresSantiago de Chile route on 1 April 1962.[18] During the 1970s, the fleet saw the arrival of three aircraft types from Boeing: the 727s,[28] the 737s,[29] and the 747s.[30] The incorporation of the Fokker F-28 into the fleet in the mid-1970s prompted the withdrawal of the last HS-748s, making the company to be the first South American airline in operating an all-jet aircraft park.[31] Frankfurt, Madrid and Rome became the first destinations to be served with the brand new 747s, starting January1977(1977-01).[32] Another milestone for the company took place in June1980(1980-06) with the first south polar scheduled service, linking Buenos Aires with Hong Kong via Auckland.[33] Late that year, a second-hand Boeing 747SP was acquired from Braniff for US$51,000,000 ($142,103,796 in 2013).[34] The airline was assigned by law the monopoly of international operations from Argentina in 1971.[35] This meant no other Argentine airline was able to operate international flights, let alone the already created Austral. The carrier therefore became the flag carrier of the country. The same law also assigned Aerolneas Argentinas a 50% of the domestic market share.[35] Following the acquisition of Austral by the Argentine government in 1980, both Aerolneas Argentinas and Austral became government-owned, to the extent that some routes were simultaneously operated, even using similar equipment. However, there existed a state of continuous tension over salary differences between both companies that eventually led the Aerolneas Argentinas' pilots to a three-week-long strike that started on 1 July 1986.[36] During this strike, the government leased pilots from the Argentine Air Force to operate some aircraft. Other companies took advantage from this situation and gained the market share Aerolneas Argentinas lost, as domestic routes were operated by Austral, LADE and LAPA, and the government temporarily authorised foreign carriers to exploit the company's international routes.[37] During the Falklands War in 1982, and for a short period later as well, the company was banned from flying through British airspace. There used to be a flight from London-Gatwick to Argentina's capital; however, because of the ban passengers bound to Argentina had to change planes at Madrid-Barajas.[38] The privatisation of the company started being considered under the government of Ral Alfonsn, when SAS was proposed to become a 40% shareholder of the state company.[39][40][41] This was firmly resisted by the Peronist opposition.[42][43] On 27 December 1989 the next government authorised the privatisation of the airline. On 21 November 1990 a consortium led by Iberia and Austral's owner Cielos del Sur S.A. acquired a 85% stake in Aerolneas Argentinas,[43][44] which became the first major Argentine company to be privatised during the first presidence of Carlos Menem. Paradoxically, one of the first actions taken by the new Peronist government was to privatise the carrier, after airily opposing to the privatisation propositions of its predecessor.[42][43] Despite the carrier being regarded as overstaffed and bureaucratic, it was debt-free at that time, having an average profitability of US$90million a year.[43][45] The carrier actually had US$719,000,000 ($1,331,645,906 in 2013) in revenues on the year prior to privatisation.[44] It was not until 2009 that this privatisation process would be ruled as illegal.[42] Austral's owner Cielos del Sur S.A. was sold to Iberia in March1991(1991-03), further increasing the Spanish flag's stake in the Argentine air market.[46] Aerolneas Argentinas and Austral never merged throughout the private era, and remained as separate companies with the same shareholder. Iberia subsequently boosted its stake in the airline to 85% in April1994(1994-04) after a US$500,000,000 ($774,472,384 in 2013) cash injection.[43][47][48][49] Out of the remaining 15%, the Argentine Government held the 5% stake it was initially assigned, while 10% belonged to the employees.[50] Furthermore, at this stage the Argentine Government resigned to the voting privilege it had in the Directory of the airline.[43] Iberia was afterwards obliged by the European Commission to cut its stake in Aerolneas Argentinas as a condition for receiving state aid.[47] It thence reduced its participation to 20%, transferring the remaining 65% to Interinvest/Andes holding, a consortium comprising the Spanish Government holding company (SEPI) the actual owner of Iberia before it was privatised in 2001 and banks Merrill Lynch and Bankers Trust, among others.[47][53] In July1997(1997-07) Iberia cut again its stake in Aerolneas Argentinas from 20% to 10%, while American Airlines's parent company AMR acquired a 10% stake of Aerolineas Argentinas/Austral's major stockholder Interinvest, equivalent to a participation of 8.5% in both Argentine companies, with the commitment of finding investors for Aerolneas Argentinas.[54][55][56] AMR's 8.5% operation was finally cleared by the United States Department of Justice in early July 1998.[47] By that time, the Argentine Government still owned a 5% stake in Aerolneas Argentinas.[57] Less than two years later AMR stepped aside, as it made no offers for Aerolneas Argentinas.[58] Plans for the employees to take an 85% stake in 2000 never materialised.[citation needed] Allegations of corruption were made on the basis of the price paid by Iberia and the Spanish firm's ulterior conduct (including some convoluted lease-back operations), with the airline paying the price for its own purchase with its assets.[43] Subsequent management by American Airlines and SEPI drove Aerolneas Argentinas into an almost terminal crisis in 2001.[45][59] By the late 1990s, the airline was near bankruptcy; losses in 1999 were around US$240million. The Spanish Government tried to sell its controlling share to American Airlines, but the offer was declined.[60] In June2001(2001-06), the aftermath began after the airline filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors,[61] and went into administration;[62] the salaries were paid by the Argentine Government, instead of using money coming from the SEPI.[63] The payment of salaries for the upcoming months were suspended, as the mechanics union refused to accept the reorganisation plan raised by the SEPI to keep the company afloat.[64][65][66] Most of the international flights were halted.[50][67] After this, most of the fleet was grounded, and only 30% and 10% of domestic and international flights, respectively, were operating.[62] The crisis deepened when the daily flight to Madrid, and also the last connection with Europe, was also disrupted.[68] Marsans group acquired a 92% stake through its subsidiary Air Comet from the SEPI in late 2001, and committed to inject US$50million capital with the intention of resuming short as well as longhaul services.[62][69][70] The resumption of international flights started in early November2001(2001-11).[71] After teetering on the brink of closure during most of 2001, combined with the adverse effects of the September 11 attacks on the airline industry and December2001(2001-12) Argentina's financial meltdown, Aerolneas Argentinas was forced to close down international services for a few days during early 2002. However, US$50,000,000 ($63,820,537 in 2013) fresh capital was provided and the airline resumed services almost immediately. The private era's first profits were announced later that year.[72][73] The carrier exited bankruptcy in January2003(2003-01) and emerged from administration a month later.[70][74] In May2008(2008-05), an agreement between the Argentine government and Grupo Marsans in which the latter would decrease its participation in the airline to 35% was announced; in reducing their holding, Marsans would make room for new private investors as well as for the government of Argentina to increase its stake in the airline from 5% to 20%.[75] Following this agreement,[76] the Argentine Government took the airline back into state control in July2008(2008-07) after acquiring 99.4% of the stake for an undisclosed price; the remaining 0.6% continued being owned by the company's employees.[3][77] The Act renationalising Aerolneas Argentinas and its subsidiary Austral Lneas Areas was passed by the Chamber of Deputies in August 2008,[78] and became law in September2008(2008-09) following the 46-21 vote in the Argentine Senate.[79][80][81] There were several disagreements regarding the deal between the government and Grupo Marsans;[82] they ended in a vote by both the lower and the upper houses of the Argentine congress in support of taking over the company and its subsidiaries,[83] when the Chamber of Deputies voted 152-84 in favor of the expropriation,[84] and the Senate approved the bill by a 42-20 vote.[85][86] In November2009(2009-11), the last Boeing 737-200 flight was operated on a scheduled Buenos AiresCatamarcaLa RiojaBuenos Aires passenger service.[87] In June2010(2010-06), Aerolneas Argentinas revamped its image to give the airline a more modern appearance.[88][89] The new logo is a combination of light blue and grey colours.[90] Likewise, the previous eurowhite livery is replaced with a combination of the Argentine flag colours plus grey.[90] Subsidiary airline Austral also adopted this new livery, additionally including a red cheatline.[91] With the mentoring of Delta Air Lines,[92] the company signed an agreement to begin the process of joining SkyTeam in late November2010(2010-11).[10][93][94] It became the first South American and the second Latin American carrier in joining the alliance in August2012(2012-08),[95][96] as well as its 18th overall member.[97] In March2011(2011-03), the different unions that affiliate the airline staff demonstrated over concerns the government was looking for local private investors to participate in ownership of the company.[98][99][100] In September that year, the airline emerged from the reorganisation proceedings it had filed in 2001.[101] In late November2011(2011-11), the government announced an austerity plan for the company in order to reduce the deficit it has been incurring since being taken over from Marsans; the plan includes the revision of unprofitable routes, the reduction of pilot/aircraft pay rates, and the abandonment of obsolete equipment, among others.[102][103] As of August 2012[update], the carrier had codeshare agreements with the following SkyTeam members: Aerolneas Argentinas current fleet Aerolneas Argentinas began modernising its fleet in 2009; early this year, the airline agreed to lease ten Boeing 737-700s and to purchase two more of these aircraft that would act as a replacement for the ageing Boeing 737-200s and MD-80s.[109] Along with the first leased ones, the two brand new aircraft which became the first ones acquired by the company in 17 years were incorporated into the fleet in mid-2009.[110][111] It was announced in October the same year that the carrier was looking for about six Boeing 737-800 aircraft, both to complement the 12 Boeing 737-700s and to replace the ageing Boeing 737-500s.[112] In late November2010(2010-11), the airline agreed to lease a further ten aircraft of the 700 series from ILFC,[113] which started being delivered in April 2011.[114] In April2013(2013-04), Air Lease Corporation announced the lease of six Boeing 737-800s to the company, with deliveries starting in November2014(2014-11);[115] in May2013(2013-05), CIT Aerospace announced the lease of four additional aircraft of the same type, with deliveries starting in January2014(2014-01).[116][117] As of November 2012[update], the airline was considering both the Airbus A350-900 and the Boeing 787-9 as replacement aircraft for the long-haul fleet.[118] The incorporation of leased Airbus A330-200s in 2013 for serving routes to Bogot, Cancn, Caracas and Miami is also planned, whereas an increased maximum takeoff weight version of the same type is also being considered to partly replace the A340 aircraft park by 2016.[119] Following is a table providing the composition of Aerolneas Argentinas' fleet, as of June 2013[update]. Information concerning seat configuration is accurate for most of the fleet; nevertheless, on some equipment this information differs from the one shown below.[110][111] As of May 2013[update], the fleet age was 11.4 years.[125] Aerolneas Argentinas historic fleet Aerolneas Argentinas has also operated the following aircraft all through its history:[125]  According to the Aviation Safety Network database, the last accident involving a company's aircraft that yielded fatalities was in 1970, as of October 2011[update]; Aviation Safety Network records 43 accidents or incidents for Aerolneas Argentinas since it started operations in 1950.[132] The company ranks among the safest airlines in the world.[133] "

aS'A law firm is a business entity formed by one or more lawyers to engage in the practice of law. The primary service rendered by a law firm is to advise clients (individuals or corporations) about their legal rights and responsibilities, and to represent clients in civil or criminal cases, business transactions, and other matters in which legal advice and other assistance are sought. Law firms are organized in a variety of ways, depending on the jurisdiction in which the firm practices. Common arrangements include: In many countries, including the United States, there is a rule that only lawyers may have an ownership interest in, or be managers of, a law firm. Thus, law firms cannot quickly raise capital through initial public offerings on the stock market, like most corporations. They must either raise capital through additional capital contributions from existing or additional equity partners, or must take on debt, usually in the form of a line of credit secured by their accounts receivable. In the United States this complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been codified by the American Bar Association as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and has been adopted in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions,[1][2] except the District of Columbia.[3] However, D.C.\'s rule is narrowly tailored to allow equity ownership only by those nonlawyer partners who actively assist the firm\'s lawyers in providing legal services, and does not allow for the sale of ownership shares to mere passive nonlawyer investors. The U.K. had a similar rule barring nonlawyer ownership, but in recent years law firms have been able to take on a limited number of non-lawyer partners. The rule was created in order to prevent conflicts of interest. In the adversarial system of justice, a lawyer has a duty to be a zealous and loyal advocate on behalf of the client, and also has a duty to not bill the client excessively. Also, as an officer of the court, a lawyer has a duty to be honest and to not file frivolous cases or raise frivolous defenses. A lawyer working as a shareholder-employee of a publicly traded law firm would be strongly tempted to evaluate decisions in terms of their effect on the stock price and the shareholders, which would directly conflict with the lawyer\'s duties to the client and to the courts. Law firms are typically organized around partners, who are joint owners and business directors of the legal operation; associates, who are employees of the firm with the prospect of becoming partners; and a variety of staff employees, providing paralegal, clerical, and other support services. An associate may have to wait as long as 11 years before the decision is made as to whether the associate "makes partner." Many law firms have an "up or out policy" (pioneered around 1900 by partner Paul Cravath of Cravath, Swaine & Moore):[4] associates who do not make partner are required to resign and join another firm, go it alone as a solo practitioner, go to work in-house in a corporate legal department, or change professions (burnout rates are very high in law).[5] Making partner is very prestigious at large or midsized firms, due to the competition that naturally results from higher associate-to-partner ratios. Such firms may take out advertisements in professionals publications to announce who has made partner. Traditionally, partners shared directly in the profits of the firm, after paying salaried employees, the landlord, and the usual costs of furniture, office supplies, and books for the law library (or a database subscription). Partners in a limited liability partnership can largely operate autonomously with regard to cultivating new business and servicing existing clients within their book of business. However, many large law firms have moved to a two-tiered partnership model, with equity and non-equity partners. Equity partners are considered to have ownership stakes in the firm, and share in the profits (and losses) of the firm. Non-equity partners are generally paid a fixed salary (albeit much higher than associates), and they are often granted certain limited voting rights with respect to firm operations. The oldest continuing partnership in the United States is that of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, founded in 1792 in New York City. It is rare for a partner to be forced out by fellow partners, although that can happen if the partner commits a crime or malpractice, experiences disruptive mental illness, or is not contributing to the firm\'s overall profitability. However, some large firms have written into their partnership agreement a forced retirement age for partners, which can be anywhere from age 65 on up. In contrast, most corporate executives are at much higher risk of being fired, even when the underlying cause is not directly their fault, such as a drop in the company\'s stock price. Worldwide, partner retirement ages can be difficult to estimate and often vary widely, particularly because in many countries it is illegal to mandate a retirement age.[6] In the United States, Canada and Japan, many large and midsize firms have attorneys with the job title of "counsel", "special counsel" or "of counsel." As the Supreme Court of California has noted, the title has acquired several related but distinct definitions which do not easily fit into the traditional partner-associate structure.[7] These attorneys are people who work for the firm, like associates, although some firms have an independent contractor relationship with their counsel. But unlike associates, and more like partners, they generally have their own clients, manage their own cases, and supervise associates. These relationships are structured to allow more senior attorneys to share in the resources and "brand name" of the firm without being a part of management or profit sharing decisions. The title is often seen among former associates who do not make partner, or who are laterally recruited to other firms, or who work as in-house counsel and then return to the big firm environment. At some firms, the title "of counsel" is given to retired partners who maintain ties to the firm. Sometimes "of counsel" refers to senior or experienced attorneys, such as foreign legal consultants, with specialized experience in particular aspects of law and practice. They are hired as independent contractors by large firms as a special arrangement, which may lead to profitable results for the partnership. In certain situations "of counsel" could be considered to be a transitional status in the firm. Mergers, acquisitions, division and reorganizations occur between law firms as in other businesses. The specific books of business and specialization of attorneys as well as the professional ethical structures surrounding conflict of interest can lead to firms splitting up to pursue different clients or practices, or merging or recruiting experienced attorneys to acquire new clients or practice areas. Results often vary between firms experiencing such transitions. Firms that gain new practice areas or departments through recruiting or mergers that are more complex and demanding (and typically more profitable) may see the focus, organization and resources of the firm shift dramatically towards those new departments. Conversely, firms may be merged among experienced attorneys as partners for purposes of shared financing and resources, while the different departments and practice areas within the new firm retain a significant degree of autonomy. Law firm mergers tend to be assortative, in that only law firms operating in similar legal systems are likely to merge. For example, U.S. firms will often merge with English law firms, or law firms from other common law jurisdictions. A notable exception is King & Wood Mallesons, a multinational law firm that is the result of a merger between an Australian law firm and a Chinese law firm. Though mergers are more common among better economies, slowing down a bit during recessions, big firms sometimes use mergers as a strategy to boost revenue during a recession. Nevertheless, data from Altman Weil indicates that only four firms merged in the first half of 2013, as compared to eight in the same period in 2012, and this was taken by them as indicating a dip in morale regarding the legal economy and the amount of demand.[8] Law firms can be small or can be huge. The smallest law firms are lawyers practicing alone, who form the vast majority of lawyers in nearly all countries.[9][10] Smaller firms tend to focus on particular specialties of the law (e.g. patent law, labor law, tax law, criminal defense, personal injury); larger firms may be composed of several specialized practice groups, allowing the firm to diversify their client base and market, and to offer a variety of services to their clients.[11] Large law firms usually have separate litigation and transactional departments. The transactional department advises clients and handles transactional legal work, such as drafting contracts, handling necessary legal applications and filings, and evaluating and ensuring compliance with relevant law; while the litigation department represents clients in court and handles necessary matters (such as discovery and motions filed with the court) throughout the process of litigation. The United States pioneered the concept of the large law firm in the sense of a business entity consisting of more than one lawyer. The first law firms with two or more lawyers appeared in the U.S. just prior to the American Civil War (18611865).[12] The idea gradually spread across the Atlantic to England, although "English solicitors remained a corps of solo practitioners or very small partnerships until after World War II."[13] Today, the United States (and the United Kingdom) have many small firms (2 to 50 lawyers) and midsize firms (50 to 200 lawyers).[14] Lawyers in small cities and towns may still have old-fashioned general practices, but most urban lawyers tend to be highly specialized due to the overwhelming complexity of the law today.[15] Thus, some small firms in the cities specialize in practicing only one kind of law (like employment, antitrust, intellectual property, telecommunications or aviation) and are called boutique law firms.[16] A 21st Century development has been the appearance of the virtual law firm, a firm with a virtual business address but no brick & mortar office location open to the public, using modern telecommunications to operate from remote locations and provide its services to international clients, avoiding the costs of maintaining a physical premises with lower overheads than traditional law firms. This lower cost structure allows virtual law firms to bill clients on a contingency basis rather than by billable hours paid in advance by retainer. [17] The largest law firms have more than 1,000 lawyers. These firms, often colloquially called "megafirms" or "biglaw", generally have offices on several continents, bill US$750 per hour or higher, and have a high ratio of support staff per attorney.[18][19] Because of the localized and regional nature of firms, the relative size of a firm varies.[20] The largest firms like to call themselves "Big-Law" firms because they have sections specializing on each category of legal work, which in the U.S. usually means mergers and acquisitions transactions,[21] banking, and certain types of high-stakes corporate litigation. These firms rarely do plaintiffs\' personal injury work. However the largest law firms are not very large compared to other major businesses (or even other professional services firms). In 2008, the largest law firm in the world was the British firm Clifford Chance, which had revenue of over US$2 billion. This can be compared with $404 billion for the world\'s largest firm by turnover Exxon Mobil and $28 billion for the largest professional services firm Deloitte.[22] The largest law firms in the world are headquartered primarily in the United Kingdom and the United States. However, large firms of more than 1,000 lawyers are also found in Australia (Minter Ellison (1,500 attorneys), China (Dacheng 2,100 attorneys) and Spain (Garrigues, 2,100 attorneys). The American system of licensing attorneys on a state-by-state basis, the tradition of having a headquarters in a single U.S. state and a close focus on profits per partner (as opposed to sheer scale) has to date limited the size of most American law firms. Thus, whilst the most profitable law firms in the world remain in New York, four of the six largest firms in the world are based in London in the United Kingdom.[23] But the huge size of the United States results in a larger number of large firms overall  a 2003 survey found that the United States alone had 901 law firms with more than 50 lawyers, while there were only 58 such firms in Canada, 44 in Great Britain, 14 in France, and 9 in Germany.[24] There is an increasing tendency towards globalisation of law firms. Due to their size, the U.S.- and U.K.-based law firms are the most prestigious and powerful in the world, and they tend to dominate the international market for legal services. A 2007 research paper noted that firms from other countries merely pick up their leftovers: "[M]uch of the competition is relatively orderly whereby predominantly Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian firms compete for business not required by English or American law firms."[25] As a result of the U.S. recession in 2008 and 2009 many U.S. law firms have downsized staff considerably, and some have closed. The Denver Post reported that major law firms have cut more than 10,000 jobs nationwide in 2009.[26] On February 12, 2009, Bloomberg reported that 700 jobs were cut that one day at law firms across the country.][27] Among the firms closed included Heller Ehrman, a San Francisco-based firm established in 1890[28] and Halliwells of the UK.[29] Among those that survived, law firm layoffs became so common that trade publications like American Lawyer produced an ongoing Layoff List of the law firms nationwide that cut jobs.[30] Law firm salary structures typically depend on firm size. Small-firm salaries vary widely within countries and from one country to the next, and are not often publicly available. Because most countries do not have unified legal professions, there are often significant disparities in income among the various legal professions within a particular country. Finally, the availability of salary data also depends upon the existence of journalists and sociologists able to collect and analyze such data. The U.S. is presently the only country with enough lawyers, as well as journalists and sociologists who specialize in studying them, to have widely available data on salary structures at major law firms. In 2006, median salaries of new graduates ranged from US$50,000 per year in small firms (2 to 10 attorneys) to US$160,000 per year in very large firms (more than 501 attorneys).[31] Many large firms in major markets such as New York City,[32] Los Angeles,[33] Washington DC,[34] Boston[35] and Chicago[36] compensate new associates using the following pay scale: Other markets such as Texas[37] start at US$160,000, but the annual increases are much smaller than the above scale. With a few exceptions, markets such as Atlanta,[38] Philadelphia,[39] New Jersey,[40] Florida,[41] Denver,[42] and Seattle[43] generally start at US$35,000-US$50,000 for small law firms to US$130,000 or US$145,000 for large law firms. With a few exceptions, most other U.S. markets start within US$20,000 to US$100,000. As a result of the current recession, many firms froze salaries (no annual salary increases in January 2009), reverted to the early 2007 pay scale shown below, and/or cut salaries.[44] NYC bonuses (the highest in the U.S.) in 2007 were as follows:[45] In 2008, several firms reverted to the 2006 bonus structure (e.g., no special bonus) or creating a new scale as shown below.[46] Larger markets outside NYC typically match the base bonus without the special bonus. Smaller markets and/or smaller firms pay $5K to $20K bonuses, if any at all.[47] Some prominent law firms, like Goodwin Procter and Paul Hastings, give generous signing bonuses (e.g., $20k)[48][49] to incoming first-year associates who hold JD/MBA degrees. Most law firms are located in office buildings of various sizes, ranging from modest one-story buildings to some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world (though only in 2004, Paul Hastings was the first firm to put its name on a skyscraper). In late 2001, it was widely publicized that one personal injury plaintiffs\' firm in the state of New York has been experimenting with bus-sized "mobile law offices."[50] The firm insists that it does not "chase ambulances". It claims that a law office on wheels is more convenient for personal injury plaintiffs, who are often recovering from severe injuries and thus find it difficult to travel far from their homes for an intake interview. As legal practice is adversarial, law firm rankings are widely relied on by prospective associates, lateral hires and legal clients. Substantive rankings typically cover practice areas such as The American Lawyer\'s Corporate Scorecard[51] and Top IP Firms. Work place rankings are directed toward lawyers or law students, and cover such topics as quality of life, hours, family friendliness and salaries.[52] Finally, statistical rankings generally cover profit-related data such as profits per partner and revenue per lawyer.[53] In an October 2007 press conference reported in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, the law student group Building a Better Legal Profession released its first annual ranking of top law firms by average billable hours, pro bono participation, and demographic diversity.[54][55] Most notably, the report ranked the percentages of women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and gays & lesbians at America\'s top law firms. The group has sent the information to top law schools around the country, encouraging students to take this demographic data into account when choosing where to work after graduation.[56] As more students choose where to work based on the firms\' diversity rankings, firms face an increasing market pressure in order to attract top recruits.[57] A number of television shows have revolved around relationships occurring in fictional law firms, highlighting both public fascination with and misperception of the lives of lawyers in high-powered settings.'

In 1808 he obtained a degree in medicine at Vienna; in a short time he was professor and then director of the school of veterinary medicine. He wrote poetry, and a play of his was acted in one of the theatres of Vienna. He also published a compendium in two volumes of veterinary surgery, and an outline of botanical medicine. In 1816 he became a Christian convert, and in 1817 began the study of theology. He also became a personal friend of Father Hofbauer, was his physician, and was urged by him to devote himself to preaching, after ordination. Veith was ordained, 26 August 1821, and the next month joined the Redemptorists at Maria Stiegen. He was a Redemptorist preacher at Maria Stiegen, 182130; preacher at the Cathedral of St. Stephen, 183145; retired cathedral preacher, until his total blindness, 184563; finally, a writer of ascetic devotional works until his death. Veith was buried in the Matzleinsdorfer cemetery of Vienna.

In the third part of his "Erzhlungen und Humoresken" he gives the "Aphorismen fr Diener der Kirche von einem Kirchendiener". In the summer of 1869 Veith received an English translation of his "Leidenswerkzeuge" from Theodore Noethen, parish priest at Albany, U.S.A., the work itself being published at Boston. He published three prayer-books: From 1863 Veith was both blind and deaf. He could not preach, but he wrote lectures on spiritual exercises for publication, and supplemented and completed his books of meditations:'

aS"The Defense Intelligence Headquarters (, Jhhonbu?)[1] is the official signals intelligence agency of the Japanese government, under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Ministry of Defense. It is currently one of the biggest Japanese intelligence agencies[2] with its creation and structure modeled after the American Defense Intelligence Agency.[3] Back in the 1980s, the former Japanese Defense Agency had several intelligence divisions with different duties. Among these intelligence division in the Defense Agency had included those from the Central Data Command Unit, the Joint Staff Council's Second Office and the three branches of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.[4] A supposed plan to integrate the intelligence divisions of the three JSDF branches started in 1988 before lack of cooperation and subordination ended it.[4] Plans to consolidate all the intelligence bureaus of the old Defense Administration into one agency had started in the 1990s[5] after the Diet of Japan had passed a law on May 1996, calling for the creation of a central military intelligence agency before the DIH was eventually established on January 20, 1997[3][6] after intelligence units from the JSDF, Japanese Defense Agency and the Joint Staff council are united[7] with the appointment of Lieutenant General Kunimi Masahiro as the agency's first commanding officer.[2] Initially, DIH civilian and military staff members were numbered at 1,580[6] with a planned manpower of 2,000 personnel[8] before it reached its current manpower of 2,300 staff members.[9] In 2011, the manpower is 1,907 members[10] Spy satellites had been planned for launch in 1998 as part of augmenting the DIH's intelligence gathering capabilities. Though two were able to launch into space, two more were destroyed in a botch attempt to send them to space.[11] In 2005, the DIH has suffered its first internal leak of classified information when a Colonel in the JASDF had been arrested for allegedly leaking information regarding the accident of a People's Liberation Army Navy Submarine that took place in the same year in the South China Sea[12][13] The DIH had announced in 2006 that a liaison office was established in Washington, D.C.[14] with the National Security Agency. The DIH is under the jurisdiction of the Joint Staff Council and is controlled by the Defense Intelligence Committee, which is made up of the heads of the JGSDF, JMSDF and JASDF with the Joint Staff Council chairman[17][18] alongside the Japanese Defense Minister[17] and Senior Vice-Minister of Defense. Command of the DIH was given directly to the Japanese Defense Minister on March 2006.[9] A number of divisions were established under the DIH, including the following:[18][19] The main role of the DIH is to collect information and analyse for planning defense and operation policy.

aS'Cody Hawkins (born March 24, 1988) is a former quarterback for the University of Colorado Buffaloes football team, and current quarterback for the Stockholm Mean Machines of the Sweden Super Series. Hawkins never lost playing football while growing up, going 590 since beginning in sixth grade.[1][2] He also lettered twice in basketball in high school. Hawkins led Bishop Kelly High School to back-to-back undefeated state championships. He was also a two-time Idaho Statesman All-Idaho Football Team Player of the Year. In 2005, he threw for 42 touchdowns and 2,783 yards with 5 interceptions,[2] earning him the 2005 Gatorade Idaho Player of the Year award. As a junior in 2004, he had 31 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.[2] Hawkins was a highly touted prospect. He had official offers from Colorado, Boise State University, Brigham Young University, University of Oregon and University of Louisiana at Lafayette but only made official visits to Boise State and Colorado.[3] More colleges were not interested because of his small size.[3] He was an EA Sports Elite 11 quarterback (#4).[3][4] He was on a reality show called ESPNU Summer House, located in the Lincoln Park district in Chicago in 2006.[2][5] His father Dan Hawkins was the head coach at Boise State and had offered him a scholarship to play there, which he accepted.[6] However, when his father switched jobs to be the head coach at Colorado, he again offered his son a scholarship to play there.[6] Cody Hawkins kept his decision on where to play until National Signing Day and even had signed both letters of intent (LOI). He surprised his father when he faxed in his LOI to Colorado, thus picking Colorado over Boise State.[7] His father would later say, "I really didnt know what he was going to do" about the surprise.[7] Hawkins redshirted for 2006. He was selected for the Offensive Scout Award by his teammates for the season.[2] Heading into the 2007 spring and fall practice, there was considerable discussion about who would be the starting quarterback for the season. The previous year\'s starter, Bernard Jackson, was still with the team, but was not considered the favorite to earn the position. Hawkins\' competition, Nick Nelson, was a junior college transfer to the team. Because of the conflict of interest, his father had publicly stated he would leave the starting quarterback decision to the offensive coordinator, Mark Helfrich.[1][8] The decision was not made until two weeks before the first game of the season.[1][6] This was the 20th time a coach would coach his own son at quarterback in NCAA Division I college football, the ninth son to be a starter.[2][4][8] Hawkins led the team to a 67 record for 2007, including the 2007 Independence Bowl against the Alabama Crimson Tide. He set the Colorado record for most pass attempts (424) and 2nd most completions (239).[9] Hawkins was, according to some, not automatically a lock to be the starter for the 2008 season.[10] Aside from continuing competition from Nick Nelson, Matt Ballenger was coming off of his redshirt season. After poor performances in the first four games of the season, Hawkins was replaced as the starter by Tyler Hansen on October 10 against Texas. Colorado does not recognize bowl games as part of the statistics. However, the NCAA does and the information is available. His 2007 stats including the bowl game are available here. In 2011 Hawkins accepted an offer to play for the Stockholm Mean Machines of the Sweden Super Series league.[12] He was also named the quarterback for the US national team for the 2011 IFAF World Cup. He is one of four siblings. His oldest sister, Ashley, lives in Portland, Oregon, and works for Nike. His other sister, Britney Brady, is married to Tim Brady, who played for his father at Boise State.[13] He also has a brother, Drew, who plays football at Boise State.[14] His father, Dan Hawkins, played collegiately at UC-Davis as a fullback, and was named head coach at Colorado in December 2005.[15]'

aS'Yuan Lang () (513532), courtesy name Zhongzhe (), frequently known by his post-removal title of Prince of Anding (), at times known as Emperor Houfei (, "later removed emperor"), was briefly an emperor of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Wei. He was proclaimed emperor by the general Gao Huan, who rebelled against the clan of the paramount general Erzhu Rong in 531, as a competing candidate for the imperial throne against Emperor Jiemin, who had been made emperor by Erzhu Rong\'s cousin Erzhu Shilong. In 532, after Gao\'s victory over the Erzhus, he believed Yuan Lang, whose lineage was distant from the recent emperors, to be unsuitable to be emperor, and instead made Emperor Xiaowu emperor. Emperor Xiaowu created Yuan Lang the Prince of Anding, but later that year put him to death. Yuan Lang was born in 513, as the third son of Yuan Rong () the Prince of Zhangwu, a key official in the Northern Wei imperial government who was a distant relative of the then-reigning Emperor Xuanwu. His mother was Lady Cheng. (It is unclear whether she was Yuan Rong\'s wife or concubine.) In 526, while fighting the agrarian rebel leader Ge Rong (), Yuan Rong was killed in battle, and Yuan Lang\'s older brother Yuan Jingzhe () inherited the title of Prince of Zhangwu. Yuan Lang was said to be intelligent in his youth. In 529, at age 16, Yuan Lang became an army officer, serving on the staff of Yuan Su () the Prince of Lu Commandery, who was the governor of Si Province (, roughly modern Xinzhou, Shanxi). In spring 531, he became the governor of Bohai Commandery (, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei). At the time that Yuan Lang became the governor of Bohai Commandery, the imperial government was dominated by members of the paramount general Erzhu Rong, who, after Emperor Xiaozhuang had killed Erzhu Rong in 530, overthrew and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang, installing Yuan Ye and Emperor Jiemin successively. In summer 531, the general Gao Huan, believing the Erzhus to be corrupt and to have lost the support of the people, rose in rebellion at Xindu (, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), and while initially he claimed to be merely wanting to overthrow the Erzhus and still recognizing Emperor Jiemin, he soon, at the urging of his general Sun Teng (), came to believe that he needed to have an emperor under his control who could issue edicts as he wished. In winter 531, he therefore declared Yuan Lang, whose Bohai Commandery was under his control by that point, emperor, even though Yuan Lang\'s lineage was distant from that of recent emperors and was not even an imperial prince himself. There is little evidence that the 18-year-old Yuan Lang exerted any real influence on Gao Huan\'s policy decisions as he battled the Erzhus. He initially remained at Xindu, but after Gao captured the important city Yecheng (, in modern Handan, Hebei) in spring 532, Yuan Lang was placed in Yecheng. Gao soon prevailed in a major battle against the joined forces of Erzhu Zhao, Erzhu Tianguang, Erzhu Dul (), and Erzhu Zhongyuan (), and in light of Gao\'s victory, the general Husi Chun rebelled at the capital Luoyang and executed the prime minister Erzhu Shilong and Erzhu Shilong\'s brother Erzhu Yanbo (), delivering their heads, as well as Erzhu Tiangguang and Erzhu Dul, whom Husi captured, to Gao. Erzhu Zhao fled back to his domain, while Erzhu Zhongyuan fled to rival Liang Dynasty. The victorious Gao, along with Yuan Lang, approached Luoyang. Gao, now believing that Yuan Lang\'s lineage was too distant, making him an inappropriate choice for emperor, initially considered still permitting Emperor Jiemin to remain on the throne, but after his generals Wei Lan\'gen () and Cui Ling (name not in Unicode) persuaded him that Emperor Jiemin would be difficult to control, imprisoned Emperor Jiemin, while instead deciding on making Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang, a grandson of Emperor Xiaowen, emperor. Gao then forced Yuan Lang to yield the throne to Yuan Xiu, who took the throne as Emperor Xiaowu. Emperor Xiaowu created Yuan Lang the Prince of Anding. However, in winter 532, about six and a half months after taking the throne, Emperor Xiaowu ordered Yuan Lang to commit suicide. Yuan Lang was buried without imperial honor, but it is not clear whether he was buried with any honor or not. Eventually, Yuan Lang\'s son Yuan Huangtou was permitted to inherit the title of Prince of Anding. After Northern Wei\'s branch successor state Eastern Wei ended and was replaced by Northern Qi, its first emperor Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi carried out a major slaughter of Northern Wei\'s imperial Yuan clan in 559. One of the victims was mentioned as one of his close associates Yuan Huangtou, who was starved to death, but it is not known for sure whether that Yuan Huangtou was Yuan Lang\'s son.'

aS'The Golden Notebook is a 1962 novel by Doris Lessing. This book, as well as the couple that followed it, enters the realm of what Margaret Drabble in The Oxford Companion to English Literature has called Lessing\'s "inner space fiction", her work that explores mental and societal breakdown. The book also contains a powerful anti-war and anti-Stalinist message, an extended analysis of communism and the Communist Party in England from the 1930s to the 1950s, and a famed examination of the budding sexual and women\'s liberation movements. The Golden Notebook has been translated into a number of other languages. In 2005, the novel was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to present.[1] The Golden Notebook is the story of writer Anna Wulf, the four notebooks in which she keeps the record of her life, and her attempt to tie them all together in a fifth, gold-colored notebook. The book intersperses segments of an ostensibly realistic narrative of the lives of Molly and Anna, and their children, ex-husbands and loversentitled Free Womenwith excerpts from Anna\'s four notebooks, coloured black (of Anna\'s experience in Southern Rhodesia, before and during WWII, which inspired her own bestselling novel), red (of her experience as a member of the Communist Party), yellow (an ongoing novel that is being written based on the painful ending of Anna\'s own love affair), and blue (Anna\'s personal journal where she records her memories, dreams, and emotional life). Each notebook is returned to four times, interspersed with episodes from Free Women, creating non-chronological, overlapping sections that interact with one another. This post-modernistic styling, with its space and room for "play" engaging the characters and readers, is among the most famous features of the book, although Lessing insisted that readers and reviewers pay attention to the serious themes in the novel.[citation needed] All four notebooks and the frame narrative testify to the above themes of Stalinism, the Cold War and the threat of nuclear conflagration, and women\'s struggles with the conflicts of work, sex, love, maternity, and politics.[citation needed]'

aS'The NEAT chipset (the acronym standing for "New Enhanced AT") was a 3-chip chipset for IBM PC compatible computers. It was developed by Chips and Technologies.[1] The NEAT chipset descended from the chipset that C&T had developed for IBM XT-compatible systems, which was based around the 82C100 "XT controller" chip. This chip incorporated the functionality of what had been, until its invention, discrete TTL chips on the XT\'s mainboard, namely:[2] The central chip of the NEAT chipset was C&T\'s 82C206 chip, introduced by C&T in 1986. This chip, like its predecessor the 82C100, provided equivalent functionality to the TTL chips on the PC/AT\'s mainboard, namely:[1] This set of components comprised most of the logic (aside from the CPU itself) on a PC/AT-compatible mainboard, and the creation of the 82C206 allowed mainboard manufacturers to significantly reduce the number of components on, and thereby the cost of manufacture of, such mainboards. However, mainboards still required four other chips, in addition to the 82C206. These other chips were buffers and memory controllers. In concert, these five chips were C&T\'s CS8220 chipset.[1] The NEAT chipset was the successor to the CS8220. It was officially designated the CS8221. It required only three extra chips in addition to the 82C206.[1] The successor to the NEAT chipset was the SCAT chipset, which amalgamated all of the chips of the NEAT chipset into a single chip, the 82C836.[1] The 8223 LEAP chipset provided support for LIM EMS 4.0.[3] Other manufacturers produced equivalent chips. OPTi, for example, produced a two-chip "AT controller" chipset comprising the OPTi 82C206 and 82C495XLC, which was found in many early 80486 and Pentium AT-compatible machines. The OPTi 82C206 provided equivalent functionality to:[2] The 82C495XLC incorporated the additional memory controller and shadow RAM support.[2]'

It became a perennial standard, recorded many times over following generations, in styles ranging from pop to jazz to country music. Composer Charles Warfield claimed to have originally written the song.[3] A copyright entry from April 1914 credits Warfield with the music, David Young with the lyrics, and Marie Lucas with the arrangement. The title of the song is given as "I Ain\'t Got Nobody and Nobody Cares for Me". Williams\'s copyright entry from 1916 for the shorter title credits the composition to Williams and Dave Peyton, and the lyrics to publisher Roger Graham.[4] Many artists had hit records with the song, starting with Marion Harris in 1916. Famous hit versions in the 1920s included those of Bessie Smith, Fats Waller, and Louis Armstrong. In the 1930s it was a hit for Bing Crosby, the Mills Brothers, Cab Calloway, Wingy Manone, and Chick Webb. Other notable recordings of include those of Emmett Miller, Merle Haggard, Bob Wills, Coleman Hawkins, and Rosemary Clooney. "I Ain\'t Got Nobody" is best known in a form first recorded by Louis Prima in 1956, where it was paired in a medley with another old standard, "Just a Gigolo". Prima started pairing the songs in 1945 and the idea was revisited in the popular arrangement in a new, jive-and-jumping style, created by Sam Butera for Prima\'s 1950s Las Vegas stage show. The success of that act gained Prima a recording deal with Capitol Records, which aimed to capture on record the atmosphere of his shows. The first album, titled The Wildest! and released in January 1957, opened with "Just a Gigolo/I Ain\'t Got Nobody", which then became Prima\'s signature number and helped relaunch his career. David Lee Roth covered the Sam Butera arrangement in 1985, enjoying a sizeable hit for himself. Butera was not credited for the arrangement and was not paid royalties by Roth[citation needed]. Although the two songs have nothing else in common, the popularity of Prima\'s combination, further popularised by Roth has led to the mistaken perception by some that the songs are two parts of a single original composition. The song was performed by the Mills Brothers in a 1932 Screen Songs cartoon of the same name. The chorus of the song is quoted in the Roaring Lion\'s calypso "The Four Mills Brothers." This song in turn was covered by Van Dyke Parks for his Discover America album and performed by Parks with the members of Yellow Magic Orchestra for Haruomi Hosono\'s birthday tribute concert in 2007. It was also featured briefly in a Harman and Ising Technicolor cartoon, "Poor Little Me", in 1935. In the 1956 Warner Brothers cartoon Napoleon Bunny-Part, the song is listed in a jukebox under the title "I Ain\'t Got No Head For My Body," performed by "The Guillotineers". Marty Feldman sings the first few bars in a scene from Young Frankenstein, where only his character\'s head appears in a line of skulls, thus making it appear as if he had no body. '

aS'The ex-dividend date, also known as the reinvestment date, is an investment term involving the timing of payment of dividends on stocks of corporations, income trusts, and other financial holdings, both publicly and privately held. In the United States, the IRS defines the ex-dividend date as "the first date following the declaration of a dividend on which the buyer of a stock is not entitled to receive the next dividend payment."[1] The London Stock Exchange defines the term "ex" as "when a stock or dividend is issued by a company it is based upon an \'on register\' or \'record date\'. However, to create a level playing field when shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange during this benefit period an \'ex\' date is set. Before this \'ex\' date if shares are sold the selling party will need to pass on the benefit or dividend to the buying party."[2] Many publicly traded companies, and some privately held ones, pay dividends to their stockholders. The question of who should be paid dividends becomes complex, as these companies are continually being traded and the composition of their shareholders changes each day. To settle this question, companies designate a date, known as the record date. Dividends are paid to the list of shareholders who hold stock on the record date. The process is further complicated by the fact that it takes time for a stock purchase to "clear" or "settle." To allow time for this processing, stock exchanges set a dategenerally two business days prior to the record dateknown as the ex-dividend date. After the close on the day before the ex-dividend date and before the market opens on the ex-dividend date, all open good-until-canceled limit, stop, and stop limit orders are automatically reduced by the amount of the dividend, except for orders that the customer indicated "do not reduce." This is done because the dividend payout will decrease the value of the company, as it comes directly from the company\'s reserves. At the market opening on the ex-dividend date, the stock will trade on an ex-distribution basis, adjusted for the amount of the dividend paid. If a corporation is distributing something other than a cash dividend, such as rights or warrants, then an ex-dividend date can be called an ex rights date, or ex warrants date, etc. The key date for dividend-paying stocks, funds, or securities is the ex-dividend date. The record date, or date of record, determines the ex-dividend date, before which an investor must own the stock in order to receive the dividend. For the investor to receive the upcoming dividend, the investor must purchase the stock prior to the ex-dividend date. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission stipulates that there are three days of settlement for stock trades.[3] The ex-dividend date is normally two business days (3 minus 1) before the record date. For the purpose of calculating an ex-dividend date, business days are days on which both the major stock exchanges and the banks in New York State are open.[4] Thus Columbus Day and Veterans Day are trading days, but not business days for calculating an ex-dividend date, since they are legal holidays and banks are not open. If the record date is not a business day, then counting begins from the most recent business day instead of the actual record date.[5] For instance, if the record date is Sunday, then the ex-dividend date is the preceding Wednesday, not Thursday  assuming no intervening holidays. The ex-dividend date is two business days prior to the record date. To be a stockholder on the record date an investor must purchase the stock before the ex-dividend date. The latest date he can buy the stock to be a stockholder on record and be entitled to the dividend would be one day prior to the ex-dividend date (this includes extended hours (pre-market and after-hours) of that day) to allow for the three stock trading day settlement of the stock purchase. If the investor purchases the stock the day before the ex-dividend date the investor would be a stockholder on the record date and would be entitled to receive the dividend payment.[6] An investor who wishes to be entitled to the dividend does not have to wait until after the record date to sell the stock; however, the investor must hold the stock until the ex-dividend date. If the investor were to sell the stock on the ex-dividend date or afterwards, the investor would still be entitled to the dividend payment. In this example, assuming that the investor purchased the stock one day before the ex-dividend date, the investor would be a stockholder on the record date. If the investor sells the stock on the ex-dividend date, the buyer of the stock would be a stockholder one day after the record date given the three stock business trading day settlement. The person that bought the stock would not be entitled to receive the dividend. An investor only needs to own the stock for one day (the record date) to be entitled to receive the dividend payment. If the investor buys before the ex-dividend date, and sells on the ex-dividend date or after, the investor will receive the dividend payment. These rules are different for special dividends over 25%.

aS'Santa Sabina is a Mexican rock band originally from Mexico City. The group was formed in 1989 by singer Rita Guerrero, bassist Alfonso "Poncho" Figueroa, guitarist Pablo Valero and keyboardist Jacobo Lieberman. Juan Sebastian Lach was keyboardist for a while. The name of the group honors the memory of Maria Sabina, the Mazatec shaman who lived in the southern state of Oaxaca. Santa Sabina are distinguished by their gothic rock and darkwave atmospheres, lyrics and stage presence. Their music, however, is perhaps best described as a variant of progressive rock which borrows heavily from jazz. At the end of the 1980s, Guerrero left her hometown of Guadalajara to attend the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City to pursue a career in theatre. There, she met Poncho Figueroa, Pablo Valero and Jacobo Lieberman, who at that time were members of a jazz group called "the Psicotrpicos". "The Psicotrpicos" agreed to provide music for a play written for Guerrero\'s theatre class based on Franz Kafka\'s "Amrika". As they worked together, they realized they had a strong artistic affinity. After the dissolution of the "Psicotrpicos", they decided to form a new rock band that reflected their artistic vision. Although the group\'s lineup has changed through the years (as in the case of Pablo Valero and Jacobo Lieberman), the sound of the group, has evolved but remains faithful to its initial course. Juan Sebastian Lach was the group\'s keyboard player on all its albums up through "Mar Adentro En La Sangre." Rather than replace him, the group instead invited cellist Leonel Perez and saxophone player Rodrigo Garibay to join. For its 15th Anniversary tour, Aldo Max replaced Garibay on saxophone. Guitarist Alex Otaola replaced Pablo Valero prior to the "Concierto Acustico" album. Drummer Patricio Iglesias left the band prior to "Mar Adentro En La Sangre." Julio Diaz was the group\'s drummer after Iglesias. Their first albums, Santa Sabina (1992), Smbolos (1994, produced by Adrian Belew) and Babel (1996) were released through the now-defunct Mexican record label Culebra Records, a local branch of BMG Ariola. Their following albums, Mar adentro en la sangre (2001) and Espiral (2003), were independent productions. In 1997, they also recorded an album of their "unplugged" performance for MTV Latinoamerica called Santa Sabina Unplugged. In early 2006, the group released a double live album "XV Aniversario" which also included a DVD. After that, the group went on indefinite hiatus. Many members of the group have remained active in music. Rita Guerrero and Leonel Perez performed as part of Ensamble Galileo. This acoustic chamber group specializes in Renaissance-era music. Poncho Figueroa organized and produced a tribute album to Mexican rock music pioneer Rodrigo "Rockdrigo" Gonzalez. He has also been performing in a trio called Los Jaiguey, along with brothers Gustavo and Ricardo Jacob, who released their first album on November 2009 and in march 2013 released their second album entitled Haciendo Tiempo (Doing Time). Alex Otaola performed with La Barranca from 19982007 and has also been active as a guest guitarist on numerous projects. His solo album "Fractales" was released in September 2007. Patricio Iglesias was absent from the music scene for almost 8 years due to various health problems. The band participated in a benefit concert on his behalf in 2005. However, he apparently made a full recovery, and in 2006 he appeared on the Cafe Tacuba triple live album and DVD, and he also played on Otaola\'s "Fractales" album. Julio Diaz performed with Jorge "Ziggy" Fratta and others as well as performing concerts with his own group. Juan Sebastian Lach moved to Europe and studied for a doctorate in cognitive musicology. He continued to write music, often with microtonal applications that involved either chamber groups or players and computers. Rita Guerrero, lead singer of the band, died on March 11, 2011, due to breast cancer, which was diagnosed in January, 2010. She had undergone chemotherapy, and as it was unsuccessful tried various treatments of alternative medicine. She was 47 at the time of her death.[1]'

aS'The Tokyo Army College (also known as the Tokyo Army Educational Center) was established by the Eighth U.S. Army during its Occupation of Japan and became a center of educational and cultural activities for members of the occupational forces and Japanese citizens alike. From 1947 to 1948, the Tokyo Army College was led by Captain Charles T. McDowell, whose staff included Chisaburo Yamada, the well known Japanese art expert, author, and future director of the National Museum of Western Art, and Faubion Bowers, who also served as General Douglas MacArthur\'s personal interpreter and aide-de-camp during the occupation and later became a respected authority on Oriental art and culture. Bowers is known in Japan as "the man who saved kabuki" because he advocated successfully for the preservation of this form of art when General MacArthur held the view that it should be banned due to its portrayal of feudal values. During the occupation of Japan, the Tokyo Army College produced numerous plays, many of which belonged to the Kabuki tradition, performed by some of the most famous Kabuki actors in Japan. Playbills for these productions are considered collectors\' items and are available through certain rare books dealers. '

aS'The Director-General of the World Trade Organization is responsible for supervising the administrative functions of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Because World Trade Organizations\' decisions are made by member states (through either a Ministerial Conference or through the General Council), the Director-General has little power over matters of policy - the role is primarily advisory and managerial. The Director-General supervises the WTO secretariat of about 700 staff and is appointed by WTO members for a term of four years.[1] The current Director-General (since September 2005) is Pascal Lamy of France. Roberto Azevdo of Brazil has been elected to succeed Lamy on 1 September 2013.[2] Before the creation of the WTO, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had a series of Directors-General.

aS'Out of This World (1993) is the first fantasy novel in The Worlds of Shadow trilogy by Lawrence Watt-Evans. The premise of the novel is that parallel universes do exist. Some have intelligent non-human life, while others are populated by English-speaking humans. Prior to the events of the novel, one such reality is overrun by a malevalent force known as Shadow. The World of Shadow is a typical high fantasy realm where magic exists and men fight with sword and sorcery. Although pockets of resistance against Shadow exist, their reality has all but been conquered by evil. Another reality, the Galactic Empire, soon finds that they are being invaded by minions who serve Shadow, and declare war. The Galactic Empire is depicted as a science fiction realm of yester-year, akin to Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers. Many planets are colonized by the technologically-advanced Empire, and telepaths serve in their military forces. Once the conflict with Shadow began, the Empire uses their telepaths to establish contact with the World of Shadow. The World of Shadow, in turn, use magic to stay in contact with the Galactic Empire. Although both realities share a common enemy, little progress is made in the way of a true alliance due to vast cultural differences. The Empire view the people of Shadow as brute barbarians who could be of no use in a real war, while the people of Shadow consider the Empire and their fascist ways as "possbly the lesser of two evils". Eight years pass by since initial contact and both sides have all but given up on receiving any true help from the other. Eventually the telepaths of the Empire discover that they have made contact with a third, as-yet-unknown reality, modern-day Earth. Independently, both worlds send diplomatic envoys to Montgomery County, Maryland, where they are either thought to be madmen or filming some sort of movie. However, a few people do eventually realize that these visitors are telling the truth and are convinced to travel to the World of Shadow, if just to verify their own sanity. However, not long after they arrive, Shadow attacks, and the group must flee through a portal to the Galactic Empire to survive. Stranded in another reality with little chance for rescue, this band of strangers from three different realities must put their differences aside and work together if they hope to survive.

aS'USS Colhoun (DD-85/APD-2) was a Wickes-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War I and later redesignated APD-2 in World War II. She was the first Navy ship named for Edmund Colhoun. Launched in 1918, she remained on convoy duty for the final few months of World War I, and she then operated out of the Atlantic for several years until being decommissioned in 1922. Returning to service in 1940 as a high-speed troop transport, Colhoun was dispatched to support the Guadalcanal campaign early in World War II. While unloading supplies to the island on 31 August 1942, she was attacked by aircraft of the Empire of Japan, and sunk with the loss of 50 men. Colhoun was one of 111 Wickes-class destroyers built by the United States Navy between 1917 and 1919. She, along with 25 of her sisters, were constructed at Fore River Shipyard shipyards in Quincy, Massachusetts using specifications and detail designs drawn up by Bethlehem Steel.[1][2] She had a standard displacement of 1,060 tonnes (1,040 long tons; 1,170 short tons) an overall length of 315feet 5inches (96.14m), a beam of 31feet 9inches (9.68m) and a draught of 9feet 2inches (2.79m). On trials, Harding reached a speed of 35 knots (65km/h; 40mph). She was armed with four 4"/50 caliber guns and twelve 21-inch torpedo tubes. She had a regular crew complement of 100 officers and enlisted men.[3] She was driven by two Curtis steam turbines powered by four Yarrow boilers.[1] Specifics on Colhoun\'s performance are not known, but she was one of the group of Wickes-class destroyers designed by Bethlehem Steel, built from a different design than the \'Liberty type\' destroyers constructed from detail designs drawn up by Bath Iron Works, which used Parsons or Westinghouse turbines. The non-\'Liberty\' type destroyers deteriorated badly in service, and in 1929 all 60 of this group were retired by the Navy. Actual performance of these ships was far below intended specifications especially in fuel economy, with most only able to make 2,300 nautical miles (4,300km; 2,600mi) at 15 knots (28km/h; 17mph) instead of the design standard of 3,100 nautical miles (5,700km; 3,600mi) at 20 knots (37km/h; 23mph).[1][4] The class also suffered problems with turning and weight.[5] Colhoun was the first commissioned in the U.S. Navy named for Edmund Colhoun. The second Colhoun was a Fletcher-class destroyer commissioned in 1944.[3] Colhoun was launched on 21 February 1918 from Fore River Shipyard and sponsored by Helen A. Colhoun, the daughter of Edmund Ross Colhoun. She was commissioned on 13 June 1918 under the command of Commander B. B. Wygant.[6] Reporting to the United States Atlantic Fleet, she was assigned as a convoy escort between New York City and ports in Europe, escorting ships carrying troops and supplies supporting World War I from 30 June and 14 September 1918.[3] On 18 November 1918, she reported to New London, Connecticut to assist in tests of sound equipment which was under development at the time. On 1 January 1919, she was rushed to assist the troop transport Northern Pacific which had run aground off Fire Island, New York. Colhoun assisted in transporting 194 of the troops off of the ship, who had been returning from Europe, to their destination port in Hoboken, New Jersey.[7] On 1 December 1919, she was placed in reduced commission at Philadelphia Navy Yard, and then underwent an overhaul at Norfolk Navy Yard.[3] Between 1919 and 1922, Colhoun remained assigned to the Atlantic Fleet on reserve status, based out of Charleston, South Carolina. She took part in sporadic fleet exercises and large maneuvers, as well as taking several midshipman cruises through the Caribbean and along the east coast. In mid-1922, she returned to Philadelphia Naval Yard and was decommissioned on 28 June.[7] Colhoun was towed to Norfolk Navy Yard on 5 June 1940, and began conversion to a high-speed transport. She was recommissioned into the fleet on 11 December 1940, and received the hull classification symbol of APD-2. Following this, she underwent a year of training exercises between Norfolk and the Caribbean, where she was during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the entry of the U.S. into World War II.[7] With the war underway, she sailed for the Pacific to join the U.S. Pacific Fleet. There, she joined Transport Squadron 12 based out of Pearl Harbor, and began conducting anti-submarine warfare exercises there for a time.[7] She arrived in Nouma, New Caledonia on 21 July 1942.[3] With a shortage of combat ships at the beginning of the war, Colhoun served a dual role as both a high-speed transport and an anti-submarine warfare vessel. In this role, she began preparations for the invasion of the Solomon Islands. On 7 August 1942, she carried units of the 1st Marine Raider Battalion in the initial assault landings which began the Guadalcanal Campaign and continued to serve as both transport and antisubmarine vessel in support of the invasion.[7] On the morning of 30 August 1942, Colhoun ported at Kukum Point and unloaded stores for the U.S. Marine Corps garrison on Guadalcanal, and then exited the harbor to undertake anti-submarine patrols. Just before 12:00, an air raid siren was issued and Colhoun moved out to sea. A second alert was received at 14:00.[3] Shortly thereafter, a lookout spotted a formation of Japanese aircraft approaching using the sun as cover.[8] The Japanese aircraft, using clouds as cover, dove and released three bombs against Colhoun, two splashing nearby and one striking the after searchlight platform and a nearby boat. The bomb blew the after davits down and forward, blocking the after engine room hatches, and starting a fire from the diesel oil spilled by the boat.[7] Colhoun attempted to return fire with her anti-aircraft batteries, but the Japanese aircraft remained obscured by clouds. A second dive launched five or six bombs on her starboard side, knocking down the foremast and blowing two 20 millimetres (0.79in) and one 4 inches (100mm) gun off the ship. A lubrication oil cooler pump in the after engine room was blown through the bulkhead into the forward engine room. Another two bombs scored direct hits on the after deck house, killing all of the men there. An order was given to abandon ship, and several tank lighters arrived quickly from Guadalcanal to assist in taking in survivors. Colhoun sank at 0924S 16001E / 9.400S 160.017E / -9.400; 160.017. Fifty-one men were killed and 18 wounded in her sinking.[7] She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 11 September 1942. She received one battle star for her service in World War II.[7]'

aS"The Friendship sloop, also known as a Muscongus Bay sloop or lobster sloop, is a style of gaff-rigged sloop that originated in Friendship, Maine around 1880. Fishermen in Friendship and neighboring Bremen collectively originated the design, one influenced by the fishing sailboats of Gloucester, Massachusetts, particularly the schooner Fredonia of 1889. Although familiar as a pleasure craft today, the Friendship sloop was the traditional fishing boat used off the coast of Maine, especially for lobstering, until the introduction of the gasoline engine early in the 20th century. Friendship-area boat builder Wilbur A. Morse produced many examples from the 1880s to the 1910s. One man could manage its single-masted rig and haul traps unassisted, yet the boat could carry sizable loads. With an open cockpit aft, and a small forward cabin outfitted with bunks and a stove, it made fishing during cold weather much less arduous than in an open boat. In the 1880s these sloops ranged from 1620 feet long but over time they became significantly larger. Modern reproductions, both wooden and fiberglass, remain popular among enthusiasts. Friendship sloops are not identical in size or shape, but they share a common design and appear similar. All are gaff-rigged, with a mainsail, a staysail and normally a jib. They may additionally have a topmast with a main topsail and jib topsail (flying jib). They all have a full keel, an elliptical stern and a bowsprit. They can range from 21' to 50' but most are between 25' and 31' in length (on deck). "

aS'Illustrissimi or "To the Illustrious Ones", are a collection of letters written by Pope John Paul I when he was Patriarch of Venice. The letters were originally published in the Italian Christian paper \'Messaggero di S. Antonio\' between 1972 and 1975, and published in book form in 1976. The book was first published in English in 1978 when Cardinal Luciani (as he was then known) was elected Pope. As the English translation only reached the public after his death (after reigning as Pope for just 33 days), it stands as one of the few writings in public circulation that indicate what sort of person John Paul I was and what sort of Pope he might have been had he lived longer. There are 40 letters in all, mainly to people in Italian history and fiction, but also to internationally well known fictional and historical characters such as Pinocchio, Charles Dickens, Hippocrates, and Jesus. Each of the letters tends to be droll and witty, but cleverly turned into a short sermon in order to make a point, whether it is on fashion, pornography, capitalism, or the communications industry.

aS'Kitaarima (, Kita-Arima-ch?) was a town located in Minami-Takaki District, Nagasaki, Japan.[1] On March 31, 2006 Kitaarima was merged with the towns of Arie, Fukae, Futsu, Kazusa, Kuchinotsu, Minami-Arima and Nishi-Arie, all from Minami-Takaki District, to form the new city of Minami-Shimabara. As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 4,203 and a density of 160.85 persons per km. The total area was 26.13km. Both Kita-Arima and Minami-Arima were part of what was known as Arima County in the south-eastern portion of the Shimabara Peninsula until they were split into two separate towns in 1889 during the Meiji Era. Kitaarima was the location of Hinoe Castle which was the estate of the Arima clan. Though initially against the Christians, Arima Harunobu eventually became a Christian himself and allowed Portuguese missionaries to build a seminary in 1580. The "Arima Semenario", as it was called, was a center for Renaissance learning. Japanese students of the Seminario received Western language, religious, and cultural training. The most famous graduates were Mancio Ito, Miguel Chijiwa, Martino Hara, and Julian Nakaura. These four young men were the first Japanese envoys to visit Europe. Arima Harunobu\'s son and his family were transferred to Hyuga Province in 1615 following Harunobu\'s execution in 1612. Hinoe castle was burned down by Tokugawa forces during the Shimabara Rebellion in 1637. The site of the destroyed castle still remains today and is a popular site for hanami, or flower viewing, in March and April. Kitaarima is a farming community that grows rice, potatoes, mikan, strawberries, and other crops. It has several distribution facilities to move produce to more populated areas. Kita-Arima-ch is situated in seven valleys that run up the southern reaches of Mount Unzen. Most of Kita-Arima-ch\'s population is centered in the southern part of the county in the town of Kita-Arima near the Ariake Sea and Minami-Arima town. Kita-Arima town is further split into smaller subdivisions; Tanigawa, Sakaueshita, Tabira, Saishoji, Oriki. The central area of Kita-Arima town contains the town office, the board of education building, bank, and the post office. Nearby is Kitaarima Junior High School which has 141 students and Kitaarima Elementary School has about 200 students. The town elementary school was built in 2004 to condense the four old elementary schools into one new facility. Also nearby are the town\'s main stores Parusu and Mizota. Parusu is a one story department store that has a supermarket, a flower shop, a clothes and shoes store, a photo shop, and a pharmacy. Mizota is a large home furnishings and 100 yen store. Kitaarima was a stop on the now defunct Shimatetsu train line which connected all of the towns from Kazusa to Isahaya. The town has several important festivals every year. The most important is Festivitus Natalis, the town\'s Christmas festival held at the elementary school sports field. This festival celebrates the Christian history of the town. The festival has musical performances by junior highschool students and guest bands. Many booths offer different foods. Other festivals include Hinoe Festival, which is held at the elementary school as well. The yosakoi Festival is held every year at Fureai Sports Park. Kita-Arima town\'s own yosakoi team performs along with other Yosakoi teams from around Nagasaki Prefecture. Other sights of interest include Sunset Hill at the highest point in Kita-Arima-ch that overlooks Obama-ch to the northeast. Across from Sunset Hill is Kita-Arima\'s brand-new camping facilities built in 2005 and opened on July 20, 2005. Kita-Arima has several old bridges constructed during the Meiji Era. The bridges include; Motobira, Arata, Tanaka, Higuchi, Omonashi, and Aratashimo.'

aS'Motel Hell is a 1980 horror comedy film directed by Kevin Connor and starring Rory Calhoun as farmer, butcher, and meat entrepreneur Vincent Smith. It is often seen as a satire of modern horror films such as Psycho and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.[2] Because of its low budget nature, the original intent was to make a serious horror film, with moments of disturbing wit and irony. Farmer Vincent Smith and his younger sister Ida live on a farm with a motel attached. It\'s called Motel Hello, but the neon O flickers. Vincent smokes meats said to be the most delicious in the area. The secret is human flesh, and Vincent has the areas around his motel strewn with various booby traps to catch victims. The victims are restrained, then placed in a \'secret garden, buried up to their necks, and have their vocal chords cut to prevent them from screaming. They are kept in the ground and fed until they are ready for harvest. Ida helps Vincent, who feels he does no wrong and sees the victims as animals. Vincent shoots out the tires of a couple on a motorcycle. The male, Bo, is placed in the garden, but Vincent brings the female, Terry, to the motel. The next morning, Vincent and Ida\'s nave brother, Sheriff Bruce, arrives. Vincent tells Terry her boyfriend died in the accident and was buried: a trip to the graveyard shows his crude grave marker. Terry, having nowhere else to go, decides to stay at the motel. Vincent and Ida subsequently capture more victims for the garden while Vincent uses his folksy charm to woo Terry, much to Bruce\'s dislike, who tries to woo her himself without much success. Vincent captures more victims by placing a pack of cardboard cow roadblocks to entice victims, and luring in a pair of swingers who have read a fake ad and believe the hotel to be a swing joint. The next day, he suggests he teach Terry to smoke meat. Ida becomes jealous and attempts to drown Terry, but Vincent arrives to save her. This is catalyst for Terry, who tries to seduce Vincent. He agrees to marry her the next day. Bruce drives down to the motel to protest Terry\'s choice. He tells Terry Vincent has \'syphilis of the brain, perhaps providing a reason for his behavior, before Vincent appears and chases his brother with a shotgun. To prepare for the wedding, Vincent, Terry, and Ida drink champagne, but Ida drugs it so Terry passes out. Ida and Vincent then prepare some victims for the wedding. Meanwhile, Bruce does detective work and becomes suspicious of his brother. Vincent and Ida kill three victims and take them to Vincent\'s meat processing plant. Doing so loosens the dirt around Bo, and he begins to escape. Bruce sneaks back to the motel to rescue Terry, but Ida returns and ambushes Bruce when he leaves the room. She knocks him out, and then takes Terry at gunpoint to the meat processing plant. Meanwhile, Bo escapes and frees the other victims. Vincent sends Ida back to the motel to fetch his brother, but the victims knock her out. Terry tries to escape, but Vincent gasses her, and then ties her to a conveyor belt. He is interrupted by Bo, who crashes through a window, but Vincent strangles the weakened man. Bruce awakens, finds one of his brother\'s shotguns, and goes to the plant, but finds that his brother has armed himself with a giant chainsaw. Vincent disarms his brother, but Bruce grabs his own chainsaw and duels Vincent. During the fight, the belt Terry is tied to activates, sending her slowly towards a cutting blade. Despite suffering several wounds, Bruce drives the chainsaw deep into Vincent\'s side. Bruce frees Terry and then returns with her to his brother, who gasps his final words, leaving the farm and \'secret garden\' to Bruce, and then lamenting that he was a hypocrite because he used preservatives. Bruce and Terry go to the secret garden and find it empty, except for Ida, who is buried head first. They head past the motel, while Bruce comments how he was glad he left home when he was eleven. Terry suggests burning the motel, claiming it is evil. The sign saying Motel Hello finally fully shorts out, permanently darkening the O. The movie was filmed at the famous Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, California with the white brick stable building as the backdrop to the motel and farm. The building and Sable Ranch locations were used in the filming of hundreds of both Hollywood and independent movies and TV shows for over 60 years. Interiors of the motel, farm, and smokehouse were filmed at the Laird International Studios in Culver City, California. In 2002, MGM released Motel Hell as part of its "Midnite Movies" collection of double feature DVDs. It was released along with the 1974 feature film Deranged. In 2008, a remake of Motel Hell was in talks, potentially directed by Steven C. Miller of Automaton Transfusion fame.[3]'

aS'Valentin Ignatyevich Filatyev (January 21, 1930 - September 15, 1990) was a Soviet cosmonaut who was dismissed from the Soviet space program for disciplinary reasons. Senior Lieutenant Filatyev, age 30, was selected as one of the original 20 cosmonauts on March 7, 1960 along with Yuri Gagarin. On March 27, 1963 Filatyev, Grigori Nelyubov and Ivan Anikeyev were arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct by the militia at Chkalovskiy station. According to reports, the officers of the security patrol that arrested them were willing to ignore the whole incident if the cosmonauts apologized; Filatyev and Anikeyev agreed but Nelyubov refused, and the matter was reported to the authorities. Because there had been previous incidents, all three were dismissed from the cosmonaut corps on April 17, 1963, though officially not until May 4, 1963. Filatyev never completed a space mission. Following his dismissal, he eventually became a teacher.[1] To protect the image of the space program, efforts were made to cover up the reason for Filatyev\'s dismissal. His image was airbrushed out of cosmonaut photos. This airbrushing led to speculation about "lost cosmonauts" even though the actual reasons were often mundane.'

aS'Lamb of God (Greek:   , amnos tou theou; Latin: Agnus Dei) is a title for Jesus that appears in the Gospel of John. It appears at John 1:29, where John the Baptist sees Jesus and exclaims, "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."[1] Although "Lamb of God " refers in Christian teachings to Jesus Christ in his role of the perfect sacrificial offering, Christological arguments dissociate the term from the Old Testament concept of a "scapegoat," which is a person or animal subject to punishment for the sins of others without knowing it or willing it. Christian doctrine holds that Jesus chose to suffer at Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his Father, as an "agent and servant of God".[2][3] The Lamb of God is thus related to the Paschal Lamb of Passover, which is viewed as foundational and integral to the message of Christianity.[4][5] A lion-like lamb that rises to deliver victory after being slain appears several times in the Book of Revelation.[6] Although also indirectly referred to in Pauline writings, nothing in the context of 1 Corinthians 5:7 suggests that Saint Paul intends to refers to the death of Jesus using the theme found in Johannine writings.[7] The Lamb of God title is widely used in Christian prayers, and the Agnus Dei is used as a standard part of the Catholic Mass. It also is used in liturgy and as a form of contemplative prayer.[8][9] The Agnus Dei also forms a part of the musical setting for the Mass. As a visual motif the lamb has been most often represented since the Middle Ages as a standing haloed lamb with a foreleg cocked "holding" a pennant with a red cross on a white ground, though many other ways of representing it have been used. The title Lamb of God for Jesus appears only in the Gospel of John, with the initial proclamation: "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" in John 1:29, the title reaffirmed the next day in John 1:36.[1] The second use of the title Lamb of God takes place in the presence of the first two apostles of Jesus, who immediately follow him, address him as Rabbi with respect and later in the narrative bring others to meet him.[10] These two proclamations of Jesus as the Lamb of God closely bracket the Baptist\'s other proclamation in John 1:34: "I have borne witness that this is the Son of God". From a Christological perspective, these proclamations and the descent of the Holy Spirit as a dove in John 1:32 reinforce each other to establish the divine element of the Person of Christ.[1] In Johannine Christology the proclamation "who takes away the sin of the world" begins the unfolding of the salvific theme of the redemptive and sacrificial death of Jesus followed by his resurrection which is built upon in other proclamations such as "this is indeed the Saviour of the world" uttered by the Samaritans in John 4:42.[11][12] The Book of Revelation includes over twenty-nine references to a lion-like lamb ("slain but standing") which delivers victory in a manner reminiscent of the resurrected Christ.[6] In the first appearance of the lamb in Revelation (5:1-7) only the lamb (which is of the tribe of Judah, and the root of David) is found worthy to take the judgment scroll from God and break the seals.[6] The reference to the lamb in Revelation 5:6 relates it to the Seven Spirits of God which first appear in Revelation 1:4 and are associated with Jesus who holds them along with seven stars.[13] In Revelation 21:14 the lamb is said to have twelve apostles.[6] The handing of the scroll (i.e. the book containing the names of those who will be saved) to the risen lamb signifies the change in the role of the lamb. In Calvary, the lamb submitted to the will of the Father to be slain, but now is trusted with the judgment of mankind.[14] From the outset, the book of Revelation is presented as a "revelation of Jesus Christ" and hence the focus on the lamb as both redeemer and judge presents the dual role of Jesus: he redeems man through self-sacrifice, yet calls man to account on the day of judgment.[15] The concept of the Lamb of God fits well within John\'s "agent Christology", in which sacrifice is made as an agent of God or servant of God for the sake of eventual victory.[3][16] The theme of a sacrificial lamb which rises in victory as the Resurrected Christ was employed in early Christology, e.g. in 375 Saint Augustine wrote: "Why a lamb in his passion? Because he underwent death without being guilty of any iniquity. Why a lion in his passion? Because in being slain, he slew death. Why a lamb in his resurrection? Because his innocence is everlasting. Why a lion in his resurrection? Because everlasting also is his might."[17] The 11th century Christology of Saint Anselm of Canterbury specifically disassociates Lamb of God from the Old Testament concept of an Scape goat which is subjected to punishment for the sins of others, without knowing it or willing it.[2] Anselm emphasized that as Lamb of God Jesus chose to suffer in Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of the Father.[2] John Calvin presented the same Christological view of "The Lamb as the agent of God" by arguing that in his trial before Pilate and while at Herod\'s Court Jesus could have argued for his innocence, but instead remained mostly quiet and submitted to Crucifixion in obedience to the Father, for he knew his role as the Lamb of God.[18][19] In modern Eastern Orthodox Christology, Sergei Bulgakov argued that the role of Jesus as the Lamb of God was "pre-eternally" determined by the Father before the creation of the world, as a sign of love by considering the scenario that it would be necessary to send The Son as an agent to redeem humanity disgraced by the fall of Adam.[20] Multiple hypotheses about the suitable symbolism for the Lamb of God have been offered, within various Christological frameworks, ranging from the interpretation of Old Testament references to those of the Book of Revelation.[21] One view suggests the symbolism of Leviticus 16 as Scapegoat, coupled with Romans 3:21-25 for atonement, while another view draws parallels with the Paschal Lamb in Exodus 12:1-4, coupled with John 1:29-36, and yet another symbolism relies on Revelation 5:5-14 in which the lamb is viewed as a lion who destroys evil.[21][22] However, as above Saint Anselm and John Calvin\'s view reject the Scapegoat symbolism for they view Jesus as making a knowing sacrifice as an agent of God, unlike an unwitting Scapegoat.[2][18][19] In modern Roman Catholic Christology, Karl Rahner has continued to elaborate on the analogy that the blood of the Lamb of God, and the water flowing from the side of Christ on Calvary had a cleansing nature, similar to baptismal water. In this analogy, the blood of the Lamb washed away the sins of humanity in a new baptism, redeeming it from the fall of Adam.[23] In the Mass of the Roman Rite and also in the Eucharist of the Anglican Communion, the Lutheran Church, and the Western Rite of the Orthodox Church the Agnus Dei is the invocation to the Lamb of God sung or recited during the fraction of the Host.[24] It is said to have been introduced into the Mass by Pope Sergius I (687701).[25] Agnus Dei has been set to music by many composers, usually as part of a Mass setting.[26][27] In Christian iconography, an Agnus Dei is a visual representation of Jesus as a lamb, since the Middle Ages usually holding a standard or banner with a cross. This normally rests on the lamb\'s shoulder and is held in its right foreleg. Often the cross will have a white banner suspended from it charged with a red cross (similar to St George\'s Cross), though the cross may also be rendered in different colors. Sometimes the lamb is shown lying atop a book with seven seals hanging from it. This is a reference to the imagery in the Book of Revelation 5:1-13, ff. Occasionally, the lamb may be depicted bleeding from the area of the heart (Cf. Revelation 5:6), symbolizing Jesus\' shedding of his blood to take away the sins of the world (Cf. John 1:29, 1:36). In Early Christian art the symbol appears very early on. Several mosaics in churches include it, some showing a row of twelve sheep representing the apostles flanking the central Agnus Dei, as in Santi Cosma e Damiano, Rome (526-30). The Moravian Church uses an Agnus Dei as their seal with the surrounding inscription Vicit agnus noster, eum sequamur ("Our Lamb has conquered, let us follow him."). Although the depiction of Jesus as the Lamb of God is of ancient origin, it is not used in the liturgical iconography of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The reason for this is that the depictions of Jesus in the Orthodox Church are anthropomorphic rather than symbolic, as a confession of the Orthodox belief in the Incarnation of the Logos. However, there is no objection to the application of the term "Lamb of God" to Jesus. In fact, the Host used in the Orthodox Divine Liturgy is referred to as the Lamb (Greek: , amnos; Slavonic: , agnets). In the Roman Catholic Church, an Agnus Dei is a disc of wax, stamped with an image of Jesus as a lamb bearing a cross, that is blessed by the Pope as a sacramental.[28] These were often set in jewellery, and might be worn round the neck on a chain, or as a brooch.

Note that this article covers only two distinct types of social clubs, the historic gentlemen\'s clubs and the modern activities clubs. This article does not cover a variety of other types of clubs having some social characteristics, for example specific single-activity based clubs, military officers\' clubs, country clubs, and fraternities and sororities. Working men\'s clubs developed in Britain during Victorian times as institutes where working class men could attend lectures and take part in recreational pursuits. The Reverend Henry Solly founded the Working Men\'s Club and Institute Union (CIU) for this purpose in 1862. Many middle class social reformers founded these clubs during the temperance movement as a place to relax without alcohol, but in time this changed. They became a combination of public houses (pubs), music-halls, and clubs, becoming places to be entertained, to drink socially, and to play bar games. Their mainly working-class patronage is not seen as fashionable among some sections of society today[citation needed], and they have come under increasing pressure regarding attitudes to membership rights for women and ethnic minorities. The CIU was heavily involved in resisting the banning of smoking in private clubs; it remains to be seen how many survive the change of law. Modern clubs include San Francisco\'s Urban Diversion which opened in 2003 as a general adventure and activities social club and Soho, London\'s Groucho Club, which opened in 1985 as "the antidote to the traditional club." The "traditional club" referred to is the elitist gentlemen\'s club, a fixture of upper class male British society. This is not to be confused with the modern use of the phrase, which now stands as a euphemism for a strip club. Clubs in England and Wales were not controlled by the licensing system until the Licensing Act of 1902 was passed, or in Scotland until the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1903 was passed. They were passed mainly to check the abuse of clubs being formed solely to sell intoxicating liquors free from the restrictions of the licensing acts, but it applied to all kinds of clubs in England and Wales. The act required the registration of every club that occupied any premises habitually used for the purposes of a club and in which intoxicating liquor was supplied to members or their guests. The secretary of every club was required to give a return to the clerk to the justices of the petty sessional division a return with this information: Social Activities Clubs are a modern combination of several types of clubs and reflect today\'s more eclectic and varied society. These clubs are centered around the activities available to the club members in the city or area in which the club is located. Some have a traditional club house, bar or restaurant where members gather, others do not. Events can include a broad range of activities from sporting events and social parties to the Ballet, the arts or book clubs. Unlike traditional clubs they are not limited to one kind of event or special interest, but include a broad range of events in their monthly calendars. The members choose which events the club is going to take part in based upon the changing interests of the members. The members themselves determine which events, of those offered, they will attend. Because the purpose of these clubs is split between general social interaction and taking part in the events themselves, both single and married people can take part. However clubs tend to have more single members than married,[citation needed] and many clubs exist for only single people, or are limited just to married couples or are limited by sexual preference(homosexuality, bisexuality or heterosexuality). Membership can be limited or open to the general public, as can the events. Most clubs have a limited membership based upon specific criteria, and restrict the events to members to increase their feeling of security, creating an increased sense of camaraderie and belonging. There are many examples of private social clubs including the University Club of Chicago, The Mansion on O Street in D.C. and New York Friars\' Club. Social activities clubs can be for profit, non-profit, or a combination of the two (A for profit club with a non-profit charitable arm, for instance). Some social clubs have function halls which members or, sometimes, the general public can rent for parties. A number of Jewish community centers and other organizations such as the YMCA have social clubs for people with social anxiety and learning disabilities. Membership in these clubs is limited to individuals with these conditions.'

aS"Jaisalmer Fort is one of the largest forts in the world. It is situated in Jaisalmer city in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It was built in 1156AD by the Bhati Rajput ruler Rao Jaisal, from where it derives it name. The fort stands proudly amidst the golden stretches of the great Thar Desert, on Trikuta Hill, and has been the scene of many battles. Its massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion color during the day, fading to honey-gold as the sun sets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. The fort stands proudly amidst the golden stretches of the great Thar Desert, on Trikuta Hill, and has been the scene of many battles. Its massive yellow sandstone walls are a tawny lion color during the day, fading to honey-gold as the sunsets, thereby camouflaging the fort in the yellow desert. For this reason, it is also known as the Golden Fort. This fort, popularly known as the 'Sonar quila' by the locals, is located in the very heart the city, and is one of the most breathtaking monuments in the locality.[1] During medieval times, the city played a major role in trade with Persia, Arabia, Egypt and Africa. The fort contains 3 layers of walls. The outer or the lower layer is made out of solid stone blocks and it reinforces the loose rubble of Trikuta Hill. The second, or middle, wall snakes around the fort. From the innermost, or third, wall, the Rajput warriors once hurled boiling oil and water as well as massive blocks of rock at their enemies, who would become entrapped between the second and third walls. This defenses of the fort include 99 bastions, of which 92 were built between the period of 1633-47. Ala-ud-din Khilji attacked and captured the fort in the 13th century and managed to hold it for 9years. During the siege of the fort the Rajput women committed Jauhar. The second battle at the fort happened in 1541, when Mughal emperor Humayun attacked the fort city. With the advent of British rule, the emergence of maritime trade and the growth of the port of Bombay led to the gradual economic decline of Jaisalmer. After independence and the Partition of India, the ancient trade route was totally closed, thus sealing the fate of the city. Nonetheless, the continued strategic importance of Jaisalmer was demonstrated during the 1965 and 1971 wars between India and Pakistan.[2] Although at one point the entire population of Jaisalmer lived within the fort, it today has a resident population of about 4,000 people who are largely from the Brahmin and Daroga communities. They are mostly descendants of the workforce of the Bhati rulers of Jaisalmer which was permitted to reside within the fort's premises.[1] With an increase in population, people gradually relocated to the foot of the Trikuta Hill and the town of Jaisalmer spread out from the fort. The fort has an ingenious drainage system called the ghut nali which allows for the easy drainage of rainwater away from the fort in all four directions of the fort. Over the years, haphazard construction activities and building of new roads has greatly reduced its effectiveness.[1] The fort has numerous eateries, including Italian, French, and native cuisines. The famous Indian film director Satyajit Ray wrote the Sonar Kella (The Golden Fortress), a detective novel, based on the fort and he later filmed it here. The film became a classic and a large number of tourists from Bengal and around the world visit the fort annually to experience for themselves the world that Ray portrayed in the movie.[1] The Jaisalmer Fort today faces manifold threats that are a result of the increasing population pressure on it. Water seepage, inadequate civic amenities, derelict houses and seismic activity around the Trikuta Hill are some of the major concerns impacting the Fort. Unlike most other forts, the Jaisalmer Fort has been built over a weak sedimentary rock foothill which makes its foundations especially vulnerable to seepage. Over the years this has led to the collapse of significant portions of the Fort such as the Queens Palace or Rani Ka Mahal and parts of the outer boundary wall and the lower pitching walls.[1] The World Monuments Fund included the Fort in its 1996 World Monuments Watch and again in the 1998 and 2000 reports due to the threats posed to it by an increase in its resident population and the increasing numbers of tourists who visit it every year.[3] The Fort is one of Rajasthan's most popular tourist attractions with as many as five to six hundred thousand tourists visiting it annually. As a result, it is abuzz with commercial activities and has seen a phenomenal growth in both human and vehicular traffic.[1] Major restoration work has been undertaken by the World Monuments Fund. According to former INTACH chairman S.K. Misra, American Express has provided more than $1million for the conservation of Jaisalmer Fort.[4] The absence of coordinated action among the various government departments responsible for civic amenities, the local municipality and the Archaeological Survey that is responsible for the upkeep of the fort is a major impediment in its maintenance and restoration.[1] http://www.jaisalmer.org.uk/tourist-attractions/jaisalmer-fort.html"

aS'Munich Airport (IATA: MUC,ICAO: EDDM) (German: Flughafen Mnchen), is an international airport located 28.5km (17.7mi) northeast[2] of Munich, Germany, and is a hub for Lufthansa and Star Alliance partner airlines. It is located near the old city of Freising and is named in memory of the former Bavarian Prime minister Franz Josef Strauss. The airport is located on the territory of four different municipalities: Oberding (location of the terminals; district of Erding), Hallbergmoos, Freising and Marzling (district of Freising). Between 1995 and 2006, passenger numbers doubled from under 15 million per annum to over 30 million,[3] despite the impact of the 11 September attacks in 2001 and 2002. In 1996, the airport overtook Dsseldorf as Germanys second busiest airport and currently handles almost twice as many passengers as the countrys third busiest airport. However (once the new airport opens), Berlin is expected to catch up in terms of passenger numbers. Munich Airport serves as Lufthansas second hub in Germany besides Frankfurt. Munich Airport is the second busiest airport in Germany in terms of passenger traffic behind Frankfurt Airport, and the seventh busiest airport in Europe, handling 38,360,604 passengers in 2012.[1] It is the world\'s 12th busiest airport in terms of international passenger traffic,[4] and was the 27th busiest airport in the world in 2011. From 1939 to 1992, Munich was served by Munich-Riem airport. First plans to expand or build a new airport were made in 1954 (traffic flow-rate, population density in the proximity). The decision for building the new airport at Erdinger Moos was made on 5 August 1969 by the Bavarian government. When construction started on 3 November 1980, a village named Franzheim was demolished and their ~500 inhabitants were resettled. The airport commenced operation on 17 May 1992, when operations moved from the former site at Munich-Riem, which was closed shortly before midnight on the day before. As Lufthansa\'s home base at Frankfurt Airport had capacity limits, Lufthansa established a second hub offering connections through Munich as well as Frankfurt. In June 2003, Terminal 2 was finished, housing Star Alliance partners exclusively. Due to the rapid increase in traffic Munich is currently slot constrained and a third runway is now being planned. Not uncommon for such a project, there is considerable opposition from the nearby residents. Lawsuits against the runway have already been announced. The airport is named after Franz Josef Strau, who played a prominent, albeit sometimes controversial role in politics of the Federal Republic of Germany from the 1950s until his death in 1988. Among other positions, Strau was a long-time Minister-President (Governor) of the state of Bavaria, where the airport is located and was initiated under his government. Strau, having been a private pilot himself, had a particular interest in the aviation industry. He is regarded one of the fathers of Airbus and served as initial chairman of its supervisory board.[5] Naming the airport by its full name "Flughafen Mnchen Franz Josef Strau" is fairly uncommon. The company that owns and operates the airport is named "Flughafen Mnchen GmbH" and brands itself as "M - Flughafen Mnchen" respectively "M - Munich Airport". In the Munich area, most people use the term "Flughafen Mnchen" (Munich Airport), sometimes "Flughafen Mnchen II" in order to distinguish from the earlier airport or simply "MUC" for its IATA-code. Most of the airport\'s facilities are located in the area between the two runways. The approach road and railway divide the west part into a southern half, which contains cargo and maintenance facilities, and a northern half, which contains mostly administrative buildings, a holiday long-term parking lot and the Visitors\' Centre. It is followed by the west apron and Terminal 1, then the Munich Airport Center (MAC), Terminal 2 and the east apron. Terminal 1 is the older terminal and commenced operation when the airport was opened on 17 May 1992. It has a total capacity of 25 m passengers per annum and is subdivided into five Modules designated with capital letters A, B, C, D and E. Modules A through D provide all facilities necessary to handle departures and arrivals, including landside drive-by lanes and parking, whereas module E is only equipped to handle arrivals. This design essentially makes each module a self-contained sub-terminal of its own, which is small and comfortable despite the total size of the terminal. Hall F is separate, located near Terminal 2 and handles flights with increased security requirements, i.e. those to Israel. Further, checkin for some flights departing from Terminal 1 is located in the Central Area Z (German: Zentralbereich). The 1,081m (3,547ft) pier features 21 jet bridges, two of which have been rebuilt into waiting halls for bus transfers. There are further 60 waiting positions on the apron, some of which are equipped with specially-designed apron jet bridges (German: Vorfeldfluggastbrcken), to which passengers are brought by bus. This unique concept allows passengers to board with full protection from the weather but without the high investments required for full satellite terminals connected through a passenger transport system. Terminal 1 currently handles all flights from airlines that are not members of Star Alliance. However, due to lack of capacity at Terminal 2, Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings and affiliate Condor moved back to Terminal 1. Further, Hall F handles flights to Israel from all airlines. Terminal 2 commenced operation on 29 June 2003. It has a design capacity of 25 million passengers per year. However, having been designed as a hub terminal for Lufthansa and Star Alliance members, it is not divided into modules. Instead, all facilities are arranged around a central Plaza. Due to security regulations imposed by the European Union, the terminal has been equipped with facilities to handle passengers from countries considered insecure, i.e. not implementing the same regulations. This required the construction of a new level as, unlike other airports, the terminal does not have separate areas for arriving and departing passengers. The new level 06 opened on 15 January 2009. The pier, which is 980m (3,220ft) long, is equipped with 24 jet bridges. As the total number of waiting positions of 75 on the East Apron is not always sufficient, Terminal 2 sometimes also uses waiting positions on the West Apron, to which passengers are carried by airside buses. Terminal 2 has two main departure level, 04 and 05 and additional Bus gates on the lower level 03. Gates on level 05 (H) are designated Non-Schengen Gates. Until the new level 06 opened the northernmost gates were behind an additional security checkpoint for departures to the USA most of the day. The lower level 04 (G) contains Schengen gates. The bus gates on level 03, also designated G, are Schengen gates, too. The terminal is operated by Terminal-2-Betriebsgesellschaft (German for Terminal 2 Operating Company), which is owned by Flughafen Mnchen GmbH (60%) and Lufthansa (40%). This makes Terminal 2 the first terminal in Germany which is co-operated by an airline. There is a baggage sorting hall on the apron, which is planned to be extended into a satellite terminal for Terminal 2. The Franz-Josef Strauss Airport has two parallel runways and one helipad. The two runways at Munichs airport are 08R/26L and 26R/08L, made of concrete and the same size, at 4,000 metres (13,120ft) long, and 60 metres (200ft) wide.[6] There is also a concrete helipad that is 98 feet across.[citation needed] The Munich Airport Centre (MAC) is a shopping, business and recreation area that connects the two terminals. The older Central Area (German: Zentralbereich), which was originally built as part of Terminal 1, hosts a shopping mall and the S-Bahn station. The newer MAC Forum built with Terminal 2 is a large outdoor area with a tent-like, partly transparent roof. Next to it is the airport hotel managed by Kempinski. Munich Airport is only location in entire state of Bavaria where one can shop at Edeka, the full-size supermarket, from 05.30 until midnight every day, including on Sunday.[7] This supermarket is given an exception from the Bavarian \'Shop Closing Law\' (Ladenschlussgesetz).[8] The airport authorities have set out to cater for visitors and sight-seers by creating a \'Visitors Park\' which includes a \'Visitors Hill\' from which a good view can be obtained of the westerly aircraft apron and Terminal 1. This is served by a railway station named \'Besucherpark\'. The view from the hill is shown in the above image. There are three historic aircraft on display in the park, a Super Constellation, a Douglas DC-3 and a Junkers Ju 52/3m. There is also a visitors viewing terrace on the roof of Terminal 2 that gives a view of the easterly aircraft apron. DBA, originally Deutsche BA, had its head office on the grounds of Munich Airport and in Hallbergmoos.[22][23] Munich Airport is connected to the city by Munich suburban railway lines S1 and S8. The ride takes approximately 45 minutes to the Marienplatz station in the city centre. Furthermore, a scheduled bus service (MVV line 635) connects the airport within 20 minutes to the Freising railway station, providing access to regional trains to destinations like Munich, Nuremberg, Regensburg and Prague. Munich Airport Station is located in a tunnel beneath the central area. A second station, Besucherpark (German: Visitors\' Park) connects the cargo and maintenance areas, long-term parking, administrative buildings and the name-giving Visitors\' Park. A second tunnel beneath the terminals is currently unused. Originally, there were plans to use it for intercity railway, then for a Transrapid maglev train making the trip to Munich Central Station in 10 minutes. However, this project was cancelled in March 2008 due to cost escalation.[24] MVV bus lines connect the airport to the nearby city of Freising as well as Erding and Markt Schwaben. Lufthansa Airport Bus provides an alternative to the S-Bahn, stopping at Nordfriedhof U-Bahn station and Munich Central Station. Munich Airport is accessible via nearby Motorway A 92, which connects to Motorway A 9 and Munich\'s ring motorway A 99 Bavarian State Road St. 2584 connects A 92\'s exit 6 (Flughafen Mnchen) - an incomplete interchange that can only be used by traffic to and from the west - to the terminals. Access from the east is possible via exit 8 (Freising Ost) and Bavarian State Road St. 2580, which connects to St. 2584 in the east of the airport. A third runway would increase the number schedulable aircraft movements per hour from 90 to 120.[25] It would run in parallel to the existing runways and be located to the northeast of the current north runway, significantly extending the total area occupied by the airport. According to Flughafen Mnchen GmbH (FMG), the airport\'s operator, the current two-runway system is already operating at full capacity during peak hours, and requests for additional slots from airlines have been denied. Further increase in air traffic is expected as Munich is to become a second major hub in Germany after Frankfurt. In August 2007, the airport operator applied for a planning permission from the government of Upper Bavaria. As more than 60,000 objections have been filed during public display of the plans, the procedures are expected not to conclude before 2013. While according to ICAO Regulations (Annex XIV) the new runway would have to be named 08L/26R (renaming the existing north runway to 08C/26C), it is currently assigned the working title 09/27 in all plans.[26] An extension to Terminal 2 will see the baggage sorting hall on the east apron upgraded to become a satellite terminal. This will allow an additional 11 million passengers to be handled per year, adding 52 gates and 27 passenger air bridges. This plan was approved in December 2010. An expansion for the satellite building into a \'T\' shape is also planned for the future along with another satellite and room for a possible 3rd Terminal to the east.[27] While Terminal 1 still has plenty of capacity left - in 2007, it only handled about 9 m passengers - the extension of Terminal 2 is required by Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners to allow easy transfers within a single terminal. When Terminal 2 and its east apron were built, preparations for a satellite terminal had already been made. Besides the baggage transport tunnel, there are three more tunnels beneath the Terminal 2 apron that can receive a people mover and extensions to the current S-Bahn rail tunnel and unused inter-city rail tunnel respectively. The preparations also allow construction of a second satellite or an independent third terminal further to the east. Construction for this satellite building has started in 2012.  '

aS'Ashley Rae Fink[1] (born November 20, 1986)[2] is an American actress and singer, known for her role as Lauren Zizes in the television series Glee, and also as Carter McMahon in Huge. Fink was born in Houston, Texas, began acting at the age of four after stealing the lead in her school\'s holiday play. After moving to Los Angeles with her family, Ashley immersed herself in acting and began attending an Arts High School, where she began performing for large audiences as leads in The Wizard of Oz (as the Lion) and You\'re a Good Man Charlie Brown (as Lucy), to name a few. Fink has said that she was bullied in high school, but that she did not let it get to her.[3] Fink has an older sister named Stephanie and two younger sisters. [4] Ashley came to Hollywood when she starred in the Tribeca Film Festival hit Fat Girls.[5] She has made multiple TV appearances; she has appeared on Make It or Break It, is the recurring character Lauren Zizes on Fox\'s Glee[6] and starred as Carter McMahon on the ABC Family show Huge.[7] She also appeared in the Walt Disney Pictures film You Again starring Betty White, Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver,[8] and in her indie horror cult hit All About Evil appearing beside Mink Stole, Cassandra Peterson, Natasha Lyonne and Thomas Dekker. Ashley has also recently broke into filmmaking herself by producing her first short starring Camille Winbush titled "Olivia", which just had its premiere at the Frameline film festival in San Francisco. Fink was cast as Lauren Zizes on the Fox television series Glee, making her initial appearance in the first season episode "Wheels" as a champion high school wrestler and cheerleader tryout candidate. She made irregular appearances until the ninth episode of the second season, "Special Education", when she was tapped to become the glee club\'s twelfth member after Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) transferred to another school. Fink has said that "I was obsessed with Glee before I was a big part of it and Ive steadily been on it for a while. When I got the script [where I joined the glee club] I texted Chris Colfer and said, \'I think I just joined the Glee club?\' I didnt quite believe it at first, I thought I was getting \'Punk\'d.\'"[9] She remained in the glee club for the rest of the season, and was given storylines of her own. Critics have responded well to her portrayal of Lauren. Robert Canning of IGN praised Fink\'s performance as Lauren, and said of the "Silly Love Songs" episode where Puck (Mark Salling) falls in love with her, "I can\'t decide if I want to root for this couple, but I certainly know I\'m going to be rooting for Lauren."[10] Fink received several positive reviews for her performance in "Comeback", in which she sang her firstand so far onlysolo on the show, a cover of "I Know What Boys Like" by The Waitresses. The song was released as a single, but it did not chart, nor was it included on a Glee soundtrack album. While Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found Lauren\'s relationship with Puck in "Comeback" "a lot less assured" than in the previous episode, "Silly Love Songs",[11] Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly deemed their scenes "as endearing as they are unrealistic".[12] CNN\'s Lisa Respers France commented that she was beginning to really like Lauren, and noted that "for me Lauren represents how Ryan Murphy is able to take the concept of the outcast, flip it on its ear and shove it back in our faces with a side order of fabulousness."[13] Despite the positive response by critics and fans alike, the series Season 3 premiere, "The Purple Piano Project", revealed that Fink\'s character would not be returning as a member of McKinnley High\'s glee club, "New Directions". While she appeared in a non-speaking role in the Season 3 episode "Asian F" and series creator Murphy alluded to her character\'s reentry into the plot through interactions with Kurt Hummel, Fink confirmed near the end of Season 3 that she would not be returning to the series.[14] However, it has been confirmed she will reprise her role as a guest star in season 4 for the episode Sadie Hawkins, set to air January 24, 2013. This will mark her last appearance in the show. Fink also appears in the music video for Stacie Orrico\'s 2004 hit "I Could Be the One."[15]'

aS'Five & Alive is an international fundraising and awareness initiative of Population Services International (PSI), which addresses health crises facing children under the age of five and their families. The program addresses health issues in children in over 30 countries worldwide,[2] focusing on educating the public of deadly, yet preventable diseases, including malaria, water-borne illness, pneumonia, micronutrients, and malnutrition. As of 2012[update], the program has purified over 40 billion liters of water and distributed more than 50 million mosquito nets to underprivileged children and their families all over the world.[3][4] Five & Alive collaborates with strategic partners to raise awareness of the effects of malaria specifically on children under the age of five. Global Ambassadors for the program include Ashley Judd,[5][6] Molly Sims,[7][8] Anna Kournikova,[9] and Mandy Moore.[2][10] Five & Alive was established by Kate Roberts in 2007, as a subsidiary program of Population Services International, where she serves as Vice President of Corporate Marketing and Communications. The health program is a collaborative initiative of YouthAIDS, an HIV/AIDS education and prevention program of PSI. YouthAIDS and Five & Alive serve to increase awareness of health crises primarily facing the African continent, the Global South and developing world, while providing practical support and programming to save the lives of poor and vulnerable children.[11] Five & Alive is an awareness, marketing and fundraising campaign of PSI that focuses on the global health crisis facing children under the age of five and their families. The program provides the education, resources, products, and care necessary for children and their families to fight off entirely preventable death and disease. Using targeted subsidies and free distribution, PSI offers long-lasting mosquito nets and malaria treatment, pneumonia antibiotics and antimalarial medication, micronutrients, rehydration salts, and water purification tablets, including WhuaAgar and PUR for individuals determined to be among those at the greatest risk for health crisis and death.[12] Every year, malaria infects between 350500 million lives, leading to over a million deaths, primarily in children located on the African continent. At the same time, pneumonia has globally been the leading cause of death in children under the age of five years. All children, no matter where they are born, deserve a healthy start in life. Nearly 11 million children die before their fifth birthday and the majority of these deaths are preventable.[13] Five & Alive promotes safe drinking water through household water treatment, a water-quality intervention that employs proven, easy-to-use and inexpensive solutions appropriate for the developing world. Five & Alive improves the lives of individuals around the world by ensuring that household water is clean and safe, regardless of its source. Five & Alive\'s water-treatment products include a sodium hypochlorite-based safe water solution, chlorine-based tablets and a flocculent/disinfectant powder that enable families to purify water at the household level.[14] The availability of these products, along with effective communications, empowers individuals to understand the burden that contaminated drinking water has on their health and allows them to take solutions into their own hands. Using both commercial marketing channels and community mobilization, Five & Alive generates awareness about the value of disinfecting drinking water, hand washing and other key hygiene behaviors.[14] Five & Alive complements its work in safe water with the promotion of oral rehydration salts (ORS) and zinc supplements to save the lives of children who may die from diarrhea-related dehydration. These child deaths are easily preventable, yet the lack of widespread knowledge and improved practices continue to present many challenges. Five & Alive\'s diarrheal disease treatment programs educate caregivers on the use of ORS and zinc and expand the availability of these life-saving products through commercial and other non-traditional channels. As identified by the World Health Organization (WHO), the integration of dissolvable zinc tablets enhances the ability of mothers and caregivers to understand and easily treat future episodes of diarrhea, which can save the lives of their children.[14] Pneumonia is the second leading cause of death among children under five. Early diagnosis and treatment with simple antibiotics can prevent a large proportion of these deaths. A severe form of acute respiratory infection, pneumonia can be treated effectively using Five & Alive\'s pre-packaged therapy kits that contain cotrimoxazole and are easy to administer. Combined with comprehensive communications, this treatment is currently provided through private sector clinics to treat pneumonia in children under five.[15] Five & Alive estimates that over 3.5 million deaths of mothers and children have occurred due to malnutrition, or "undernutrition". They attribute the cause resulting from a variety of factors, including poverty, chronic illness, inadequate access to health services, insufficient macro and micronutrient intake, unsafe water, and lack of access to improved sanitation. For young children, ensuring access to health and nutritional sustenance during the first 1,000 days from conception to age two, can break the cycle of malnutrition. The treatment program offered by the organization is cost-effective, when appropriately tailored and applied during the first two years of life.[16] The programming efforts launched by Five & Alive are proven successful, based on best-practices and evidence-based nutritional interventions, which include ensuring access to iron, folic acid, and multivitamin tablets for women of reproductive age, the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, and large scale food fortification. Access to services are provided to women and children through community health workers, private sector providers as well as public health facilities.[16] The death of children within the first 28 days of life, accounts for 41 percent of child mortality rates worldwide. Close to 50 percent of newborn mortality occurs within the first 48 hours of life. Coupled with minimal progress in reducing newborn mortality, a targeted effort is being made in order to make progress towards greatly reducing the mortality rate of children by the year 2015. In order to accomplish this, Five & Alive is focused on increasing demand and access to quality neonatal interventions. Provided services include ensuring access to immunization and vaccination, and water and sanitation, all of which can be offered inexpensively, yet has consistently shown a high-return on investment. Additional services include improving access to a full range of basic education, primarily for young girls.[17] Five & Alive readily promotes an integrated set of interventions that includes early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding, kangaroo mother care, delayed bathing, and early detection of infection, all of which are delivered by community health workers during home visits. The organization is also working to increase access to four percent Chlorhexidine (CHX), which is a simple and inexpensive antiseptic shown to reduce newborn mortality by 23 percent. This product is proven effective, when applied within the first 24 hours of birth. Five & Alive\'s health services includes clean delivery kits, antenatal-based services, private provider networks, and community-based distribution, all of which increasingly delivers consistent access to four percent CHX at scale.[17] Five & Alive works in collaboration with partners ranging from large corporations to celebrity ambassadors to other nonprofit organizations. A major partnership with Cond Nast Traveler Magazine offers financial support through their Five & Alive Fund, in addition to comprehensive print coverage in support of Five & Alive\'s marketing campaigns, resulting in increased public awareness and funding.[18][19] As a founding partner of the Cond Nast Traveler Five & Alive Fund, Crystal Cruises has raised over $180,000. Assistance has included the distribution of child survival packages in Uganda; and assistance in training community healthcare workers to provide free diagnoses and treatments to children in Cameroon, resulting in an estimated 40 percent reduction in child mortality. The cruise line additionally provides opportunity for travelers to donate financially and purchase merchandise in their onboard retail shops, with all proceeds going to support Five & Alive.[20] Partnerships with Blackberry Farm and The Inn at Little Washington have led to several fundraising events. Appetite for Life dinners at Blackberry Farm in 2009 and 2010 alone raised over $160,000[21] towards Five & Alive\'s initiatives in Haiti, while events at the Inn at Little Washington raised over $650,000.[22] Other corporate partners such as Procter & Gamble, Malaria No More, Care2, and Beam Global Spirits & Wine have been vital in sustaining the program, ensuring the organization\'s timely response to global crises, free of restrictions on time and resource allocation required by more traditional donors.'

aS'Connie Price-Smith (born Constance Marie Price-Smith 3 June 1962 in St. Charles, Missouri) is an American shot putter and discus thrower. She graduated from Southern Illinois University-Carbondale in 1985.[1] Price-Smith is a four-time Olympian, and is one of the most decorated women\'s track and field athletes in SIU history,[1] despite the fact she did not participate in the sport during her college career until she was a senior. She was also on the school\'s women\'s basketball team before she became a member of the Saluki Track & Field team. She is currently ranked fifth all-time in the outdoor shot put (49\' 11.5") and third all-time in the discus (165 1").

aS'Politics portal The Republic of Poland is a Central European country and member of the European Union and NATO, among others. In recent years, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and Western affairs, supporting and establishing friendly foreign relations with both the West and with numerous European countries. Recently, Poland has forged ahead on its economic reintegration with the Western world.[1][citation needed] Poland also has been an active nation in advocating European integration. In 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the Western European Union (WEU). In 1996, Poland achieved full OECD membership and submitted preliminary documentation for full EU membership. In 1997, Poland was invited in the first wave of NATO policy enlargement at the July 1997 NATO Summit in Madrid, Spain. In March 1999, Poland became a full member of NATO. Poland promoted its NATO candidacy through energetic participation in the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program and through intensified individual dialogue with NATO. Poland formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the Visegrd group. Poland was a part of the multinational force in Iraq. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the establishment of seven new sovereign states in Poland\'s immediate neighborhood (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia), of which Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia (through the Kaliningrad Oblast) border Poland. Poland has actively pursued good relations with all its neighboring countries, signing friendship treaties replacing links severed by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. The Poles have forged special relationships with Lithuania and particularly Ukraine in an effort to firmly anchor these states to the West.[clarification needed] Due to its tragic historical experience with a repeating pattern of disloyal allies and simultaneous aggression of powerful neighbors (e.g., Partitions of Poland, Second World War), Polish foreign policy pursues close cooperation with a strong partner, one apt enough to give strong military support in times of critical situations. This creates the background of Poland\'s tight relations with the USA and their sensitivity in relations towards its partner within the European Union, Germany. At the same time, the equally burdened attitude towards Russia results in very tense diplomatic relations, which have been constantly worsening since Vladimir Putin\'s rise to power. This is an important factor for the special attention Poland pays to the political emancipation[clarification needed] of all its Eastern neighbors: Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.[citation needed] Jan Pastwa is the Polish Ambassador to Prague.[12] Jan echter is the Czech Ambassador to Warsaw.[13] Denmark and Poland have still not agreed on the formal establishment of the maritime border between the two countries. Denmark supports a border half-way between the two countries, but Poland wants to be awarded an even greater share of the Baltic Sea, since Poland has a much longer coastline than the Danish island of Bornholm. The issue has gained significance alongside Russia\'s plans to build the controversial Nord Stream natural gas pipeline through the disputed area. Polish-French relations date several centuries, although they became really relevant only with times of French Revolution and reign of Napoleon I. Poles have been allies of Napoleon; large Polish community settled in France in the 19th century, and Poles and French were also allies during the interwar period. The official relations, having cooled down during the Cold War, have improved since the fall of communism. Currently both countries are part of the European Union and NATO. During the Cold War, communist Poland had good relations with East Germany, but had strained relations with West Germany. After the fall of communism, Poland and the reunited Germany have had a mostly positive but occasionally strained relationship due to some political issues. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Germany has been a proponent of Poland\'s participation in NATO and the European Union. The Polish-German border is 467km long.[17] Relations between the two states date back from the Middle Ages. For a long time, they enjoy traditional close friendship. Hungary has an embassy in Warsaw, a general consulate in Krakw and 2 honorary consualtes (in d and Pozna). Poland has an embassy in Budapest. The fall of communism in the years of 1989-1991 led to a formal reestablishment of relations by the Polish and Lithuanian states. Poland was highly supportive of the Lithuanian independence, and became one of the first countries to recognize independent Lithuania.[20] Despite that, there was a relative crisis in the early 1990s,[21] due to Lithuanian mistreatment of Polish minority, and Lithuanian suspicious that Poland would want to put Lithuania under its sphere of influence.[20] After a few years, as the situation normalized, Polish-Lithuanian relations have been steadily improving over the past two decades, with both countries joining the NATO and European Union. Lithuania has an embassy in Warsaw. Poland has an embassy in Vilnius, a consulate general in Sejny and an honorary consulate in Klaipda. There are around 250,000 Poles living in Lithuania and around 25,000 ethnic Lithuanians living in Poland. Both countries are full members of the Council of the Baltic Sea States. Both countries share a common border of 103km.[17] In recent years, relations with Russia have worsened considerably. Poland responded with strong disapproval towards the 2008 Georgian Crisis, in which a military invasion of Georgia was led by Russia. Georgia is a former USSR republic, Poland was a member of the Eastern Bloc, and Poland stated its support for Georgia and condemned Russia\'s actions. The Polish believed the invasion was carried out by the Russians in an attempt to reestablish and reassert its dominance over its former republics. In 2010, however, relations with Russia significantly improved in context of plane accident with Polish president on the board in Smolensk. Both countries share a border of about 529km.[17] Poland\'s acceptance of the Schengen Agreement created problems with the Ukrainian border traffic. On July 1, 2009 an agreement on local border traffic between the two country\'s came into effect. This agreement enables Ukrainian citizens living in border regions to cross the Polish frontier according to a liberalized procedure.[26] The Orange Revolution in Ukraine evoked a wide and authentic support within the Polish society.[citation needed] During the cold war Poland retained a largely negative view of Britain as a sluggish ally of Poland during World War II, later acceptance of neglecting Poland in the international arena and placing it in communist influences. In communist times the UK was a part of the NATO block, so consequently it was considered by the communists as natural enemy of "communist block". British efforts meanwhile were focussed at trying to break Poland off from the Warsaw Pact and encouraging reforms in the country. In the 1990s and 2000s democratic Poland has maintained close relations with Britain; both in defence matters and within the EU; Britain being one of only a few countries allowing equal rights to Polish workers upon their accession in 2004.[27] Historically, relations have generally been close and friendly, characterized by understanding and cooperation on international front.[34] Poland broke off relations with Israel after the Six-Day War of 1967, following most other countries of the Soviet Union controlled Eastern Bloc. Poland was the first Eastern bloc country to recognize Israel again in 1986. Full diplomatic relations have been reestablished in 1990, after the communist People\'s Republic of Poland was transformed into modern, democratic Poland. Government relations between Poland and Israel are steadily improving, resulting in the mutual visits of presidents and the ministers of foreign affairs. Poland maintains its embassy in Pyongyang and DPRK maintains its embassy in Warsaw. As of 2009, Republic of Poland and DPRK signed 16 bilateral treaties, 12 as People\'s Republic of Poland and 4 as Republic of Poland[38] A tighter security alliance with the United States was announced in the middle of the Georgian crisis as an agreement between the two countries was reached to allow the US to install and operate an interceptor missile defense shield, a move which Russia sees explicitly targeting it and which it stated made Poland "a legit military target."[39] A high-ranking Russian military official said, "Poland in deploying [the US system] opens itself to a nuclear strike."[40] Since 6 February 2012, Poland serves as the protecting power of the United States in Syria.[41] This article incorporatespublic domain material from websites or documents of the CIA World Factbook.'

aS'A Hong Kong musical tongue twister (Chinese: ) is a melody rhyme that follow a musical tune. Such tongue twisters are extremely short, and contain some addictive background music. Within Hong Kong culture, they have been classified under the heading of TV theme songs. However, they are not songs written in entirety or featured on any albums. Usually most tunes last no more than 20 seconds. The tunes are used almost exclusively for commercials. The two famous composers who wrote all the twisters and sang them for broadcasts was Wong Jim and Joseph Koo. They were meant to be comedic or cheery in terms of creating a friendly atmosphere for selling the products. This trend was mostly in the 1960s and 1970s. In one of their last concerts together, they re-sang all their tunes in the performance along with a number of recognizable TV theme songs.

aS'Sir Christopher Blount (1555/1556[1]  18 March 1601) was an English soldier, secret agent, and rebel. He served as a leading household officer of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester. A Catholic, Blount corresponded with Mary, Queen of Scots\'s Paris agent, Thomas Morgan, probably as a double agent. After the Earl of Leicester\'s death he married the Dowager Countess, Lettice Knollys, mother of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Blount became a comrade-in-arms and confidant of the Earl of Essex and was a leading participant in the latter\'s rebellion in February 1601. About five weeks later he was beheaded on Tower Hill for high treason. Christopher Blount was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, the younger son of Thomas Blount, a relative of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester on the Earl\'s mother\'s side, and one of his chief household officers until his death in 1568.[2] Blount\'s mother was Mary Poley from a Suffolk Catholic family. As a child Christopher Blount was sent to Louvain to be privately tutored by William Allen.[3] Despite being a Catholic, he was Gentleman of the Horse to the Earl of Leicester by 1584.[4] He corresponded with Thomas Morgan in Paris, the exiled agent of Mary, Queen of Scots. Apparently Blount offered to "do [her] notable service".[5] In his dealings with Morgan Blount probably had the backing of Leicester and Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth\'s spymaster.[3] Leicester trusted Blount, calling him "Mr. Kytt" and caring for his well-being.[6] Blount served in the Netherlands Campaign from 1585 till 1587, when Leicester was Governor-General there.[7] In the spring of 1589, about seven months after the Earl\'s death, Blount married his widow, Lettice Knollys, whom Queen Elizabeth hated for having married the Earl of Leicester.[8] Accordingly, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, Lettice\'s son and the new favourite of the Queen, termed this an "unhappy choice".[9] Lettice seems to have been very happy with her choice, as is shown by her later correspondence.[10] Lady Leicester (she continued to be styled thus) and Sir Christopher were busy repaying the Earl of Leicester\'s colossal debts and were engaged in numerous law-suits because of this.[1] Blount was Member of Parliament for Staffordshire, where he lived, in the Parliaments of 1593 and 1597; he was elected at the instance of the Earl of Essex, who was influential in the county.[11] In 1596, Blount was a colonel in the Cadiz expedition, and in 1597 in that to the Azores.[1] One of the main followers of the Earl of Essex, he became much involved in the latter\'s rebellion in 1601. On Sunday, 8 February, he tried to raise London, riding side by side with his stepson, the Earl, and was badly wounded in the cheek.[12] Following his arrest, he was carried on a litter to his trial, still weak from his hurt. He was beheaded about four weeks after Essex on Tower Hill for high treason.[1]'

As of 15 July 2013, she is ranked world no. 33 and is the second highest ranked Romanian player after Simona Halep. She achieved her career-high ranking of world no. 22 on 17 June 2013[3] and has appeared in the quarterfinals of the French Open and the semifinals of the Los Angeles Open.[4] Crstea is a power player with a deceptively good serve. Her groundstrokes are often erratic with an emphasis on going for a winner leading her to make a high amount of unforced errors per match but with a high number of winners.[5] According to the Tennis Spy, she does not appear to be fast around the court, but actually is deceptively quick covering the ground with her long strides and good reading of the game.[5] As a good doubles player, she is also a very solid volleyer, and also has solid groundstrokes.[5] Her forehands and backhands are delivered quickly on both sides.[5] Crstea was born to Mihai and Liliana in Bucharest,[6] but currently resides in Trgovite.[7] She also has a brother, Mihnea, five years her junior.[6] Crstea was introduced to tennis at the age of four by her mother. "My mum and dad have always followed tennis and they encouraged me to start playing the sport when I was young. They\'re the reason I started to play tennis and I guess they are the ones I should thank for getting me into it".[7] She has cited Steffi Graf and Roger Federer as her idols.[7] Crstea speaks Romanian, English, Spanish, and French.[6] Crstea is a former ITF Junior Circuit top-ten player, reaching her highest ranking of no. six on June 26, 2006.

aS"Female Herm and Male Herm are a set of two neoclassical marble herms in the outdoor sculpture collection of the historic Oldfields estate, located on the campus of the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA), in Indianapolis, Indiana. Together the herms depict either Dionysus and a Maenad or a dryad and a satyr.[1][2][3] Each herm consists of a head and upper torso blended into a simple, squared column that tapers to a narrow width and then expands slightly outward into a more decorative, banded rectangular base. The female figures head leans slightly back, looking a little to the proper left and up. Her facial expression is relaxed and she smiles widely, showing her teeth. Her long hair is tucked back loosely and adorned with a wreath of flowers. Unlike the male herm, the female has certain extremities included that are truncated by the sculptor. The figures proper left shoulder is raised as though the arm is extended outward, but the arm is instead cut smooth in a vertical plane about an inch out from the armpit. The otherwise exposed left breast is hinted at but again truncated into a smooth plane in line with the front side of the pillar. A sheepskin is draped over her proper right shoulder and breast and wrapped around the back so that two hoofed legs tie in front, under the plane of the left breast. The sheeps head hangs down her proper right side. A cascading series of wildflowers extends down from under the hoofs almost to the base. The male figure's head turns regally on its muscular neck to align with the proper right front edge of the column. The strong-featured face bears a medium-length, wavy beard that comes to two slight points on the chin. The hair is crowned with a grape vine with bountiful leaves and grape clusters draping down along the neck on the proper left. The torso and upper column are draped with a feline skin which is tied by the front limbs on the front of the sculpture. The surface of the skin is heavily drilled, either to evoke a wooliness of the fur or to represent the spots of a leopard with shadow. Another grape vine trails down and to the proper left from beneath the tied paws.[3] The herm (from the Greek , the messenger of the Gods and patron of thieves and travelers) follows a sculptural tradition begun in ancient Greece, in which a human head was carved on top of a squared pillar or pedestal of proportionate body height. Archaic herms, used as road markers and signs of auspiciousness, usually depicted the god Hermes and frequently included the male genitalia carved directly onto the pillar at the appropriate height. Later the herm became less rigid in its use and served as a template for portraits, a tradition adopted by the Romans. During the Renaissance the herm received a resurgence of popularity as both a decorative and an architectural form.[3][4] Here the Neoclassical tradition has taken the ancient genre and used it to depict another ancient theme. The plants and skins shown on the two sculptures reflect both pastoral settings and Bacchic revelry. The male herm may represent the god Dionysus, who was often depicted with grapes and a leopard, but pointed ears on this herm may indicate that it is not the god himself but rather one of his satyr followers. Likewise the female herm may be a dryad (nymph of the woods, often paired with satyrs or fauns), or a Maenad (a human female devotee of Dionysus), often described as clad in skins and cavorting madly or drunkenly, as this figures vibrant posture may suggest.[3] The grounds of Oldfields were landscaped by Percival Gallagher of the Olmsted Brothers in the 1920s. The property and all sculptures on it were donated to the IMA by the family of former Oldfields owner Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., in 1967. In 2001 the outdoor sculptures were assessed, and eighteen selected pieces were accessioned into the IMAs Lilly House collection. Female Herm was assigned Accession Number LH2001.240, and Male Herm was assigned LH2001.241. The maker and place of origin are unknown. The material is Carrara marble, widely used for sculpture and quarried around Carrara, Italy; thus the sculpture set may have been made in Italy. The two herms were clearly manufactured and sold as a set, as indicated by the symmetry of form and subject matter. It is not known with certainty when this sculpture set was first brought to the Oldfields estate, but it is documented in historic photographs from the Landon era.[3][5] The herms were originally positioned on either side of the north entrance path of the Formal Garden. The two are aligned on an east-west axis, with Female Herm on the eastern side of the path and Male Herm on the western. They have remained in approximately the same place since (with the exception of some time in storage during the 1992 Formal Garden renovation).[3] The marble sculptures are monitored, cleaned, and treated regularly by the IMA art conservation staff. Both sculptures are considered structurally sound and stable as of 2011.[3][6]"

aS'The "Horatio Alger myth" refers to a perceived characteristic trajectory - and attendant ethic or message - found in the novels of Horatio Alger, Jr.. Alger wrote over 100 books for young working class males, a well-known early example of which is Ragged Dick, which was published in 1867. His books have been described as rags to riches stories, although often \'rags to middle class respectability\' might be more accurate.[1] "By leading exemplary lives, struggling valiantly against poverty and adversity", Alger\'s protagonists gain both wealth and honor, ultimately realizing the American Dream.[2] The characters in Alger\'s stories sometimes improved their social position through the aid of an older, kindly, wealthly helping person. The association of Alger\'s stories with the \'rags to riches\' trope is somewhat misleading, as his heroes rarely become extremely wealthy. His characters usually achieve "low-level jobs in companies, often attaining personal stability but not wealth or prominent position".[citation needed] Some of Alger\'s novels assert that material wealth is insignificant unless it is paired with middle-class respectability. For Alger\'s characters, wealth was the product of a meritocracy, and the direct consequence of "honesty, thrift, self-reliance, industry, a cheerful whistle and an open manly face". However, in some of Alger\'s works there is also an implied belief in hereditary determinism, explicitly contrasting achievement based on merit.[3] Scholars have conflicting views over the validity of Horatio Alger\'s moral in his stories. During the 1930s and 1940s, Alger\'s works were virtually out of print and many commentators seemed to have regarded Alger as a propagandist, with one referring to him as "the author who celebrated capitalist markets and insisted that in the United States, any poor boy with patience and an unwavering commitment to hard work can become a dazzling success".[4] While those moving between income brackets and improving their socio-economic status may not be experiencing dazzling success, there is some evidence that the United States may be a land of opportunity,[citation needed] highlighted by, "the potential greatness of the common man, rugged individualism, [and] economic triumph".[4] In his book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, journalist Hunter S. Thompson made repeated references to Horatio Alger during his search for the American Dream. He called the Circus Circus Las Vegas, which he considered the main nerve of the American Dream, "pure Horatio Alger"\' The final line of the book is Thompson saying that he thinks of himself as a "monster reincarnation of Horatio Alger. A Man on the Move, and just sick enough to be totally confident"\'. Academy Award winning American filmmaker, author, and liberal political commentator Michael Moore is vocal in his opposition to the Horatio Alger myth. In 2003, Moore remarked, "So, here\'s my question: after fleecing the American public and destroying the American dream for most working people, how is it that, instead of being drawn and quartered and hung at dawn at the city gates, the rich got a big wet kiss from Congress in the form of a record tax break, and no one says a word? How can that be? I think it\'s because we\'re still addicted to the Horatio Alger fantasy drug. Despite all the damage and all the evidence to the contrary, the average American still wants to hang on to this belief that maybe, just maybe, he or she (mostly he) just might make it big after all". [5] Max B. Sawicky, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who has worked in the Office of State and Local Finance of the U.S. Treasury Department and the US Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, also refutes the Horatio Alger myth. In a column on the five leading concerns for populist economics, Sawicky wrote, "trade policy alone is woefully inadequate to significantly lightening the burdens of the working class[Populism\'s] point of departure is the domination of monied elites who jury rig commerce and call it free enterprise, who marginalize dissent and call it democracy. It rejects the Horatio Alger myth, with its false promise that if you study, work hard, and play by the rules, economic security will be yours".[6] Harlon L. Dalton, Professor of Law at Yale University, not only objects to the Horatio Alger myth, but also maintains that it is socially destructive. Dalton explains that the Horatio Alger myth conveys three basic messages, "(1) each of us is judged solely on her or his own merits; (2) we each have a fair opportunity to develop those merits; and (3) ultimately, merit will out. Each of them is, to be charitable, problematic".[7] The first message is a variant on the rugged individualism ethosIn this form, the Horatio Alger myth suggests that success in life has nothing to do with pedigree, race, class background, gender, national origin, sexual orientationin short, with anything beyond our individual control. Those variables may exist, but they play no appreciable role in how our actions are appraised".[7] Dalton also believes that the deep appeal of the Horatio Alger myth is that it allows and even pulls people in the direction they want to go. Psychologically, the Horatio Alger myth opens many doors. When the odds are stacked unfavourably, one often has to convince oneself that "there is a reason to get up in the morning".[7] Dalton also asserts that the myth serves to maintain the racial pecking order. It does so by mentally bypassing the role of race in American society, by fostering beliefs that themselves serve to trivialize, if not erase, the social meaning of race. The Alger myth encourages people to blink at the many barriers to racial equality (historical, structural, and institutional) that litter the social landscape and believe that all it takes to be successful in America is initiative, persistence, hard work, and pluck. According to Dalton, there is a fundamental tension between the realization of the American Dream based on the Alger myth and the harsh realities of a racial caste system. Obviously, the main point of such a system is to promote and maintain inequality. Conversely, the main point of the Alger myth "is to proclaim that everyone can rise above her station in life. Despite this tension, it is possible for the myth to coexist with social reality. Not surprisingly, then, there are lots of Black folk who subscribe to the Alger myth and at the same time understand it to be deeply false. They live with the dissonance between myth and reality because both are helpful and healthful in dealing with the adverse events of life. Many Whites, however, have a strong interest in resolving the dissonance in favor of the myth. Far from needing to be on guard against racial "threat[s] or challenge[s]", they would just as soon put the ugliness of racism out of mind. For them, the Horatio Alger myth provides them the opportunity to do just that".[7] The myth suggests we are judged solely on our individual merits, in turn implying that caste has little practical meaning, apart from race-based advantages or disadvantages. Generally Whites are more successful than African Americans, as they are facilitated by their preferred social position, while African Americans believe that they can "simply lift themselves up by their own bootstraps". It is in America\'s national interest, Dalton believes, to give the Horatio Alger myth a rest, because it is a myth that assures us we can have it all, when in reality, "we live today in an era of diminished possibilities".[7]'

aS'Boone Hospital Center is a county-owned not-for-profit hospital in Columbia, Missouri, USA. The hospital is administered by BJC HealthCare, based in St. Louis, Missouri. The hospital is a regional referral center, providing services to twenty-five Mid-Missouri counties. The hospital employs over 2000 people, making it one of the larger employers in Columbia.[1] Built in 1921, the original Boone County Hospital was a 40-bed facility serving the citizens of Boone and surrounding counties. Due to increased demand, an addition to the facility were opened in 1954, called the Nifong Wing, after Dr. Frank Nifong, a prominent Columbia physician and fundraiser for the hospital. Voters also agreed in 1955 to fund a $3 million, 200-bed expansion that was completed in 1959. This new six-story east wing brought the total number of patient beds to 250.[2] By 1962, the hospital had an average of 158 patients every day within the facility and space was becoming an issue. In 1973 a new four story patient care tower was completed that added much needed space for patients, as well as additional parking for visitors. The top two floors of the tower remained unfinished until funds were available.[3] In 1974, workers began $290,000 worth of remodeling in the hospital wing built in 1959, updating crucial aspects of the facility infrastructure. Also completed in 1974 was a 16-bed psychiatric unit staffed by six specially trained nurses, which opened on the second floor. This facility operated until 2008, when an economic downturn forced employee layoffs.[4] In 1975, Boone County Hospital made great strides in the ground-breaking field of nuclear medicine with the purchase of two pieces of supplementary equipment for its "gamma camera." Thanks to this new acquisition doctors were able to get clear images of internal organs through the use of radioisotope solution injections. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Boone County Hospital would be one of the first facilities in the nation to acquire a whole body scanner, which represented the very latest in radiological diagnosis.[5] A two-story wing was added in 1978 that that housed radiology, surgery, diagnostic treatment, emergency care and obstetrics. In addition, the top two floors of the patient tower built in 1973 were completed, along with 120 new parking spaces and two new elevators. In 1982 Boone Hospital Center opened a clinic in Centralia, Missouri to better serve the residents of northern Boone County. Boone\'s board of trustees voted in 1988 to approve a ten-year lease agreement with Christian Health Services, thereby relinquishing county government\'s central role in the hospital\'s operation yet maintaining ownership of the plant and property. In 1993 Christian Health Services merged with Barnes and Jewish hospitals in St. Louis to form Barnes-Jewish-Christian Healthcare (BJC).[6] In 2006 the board of trustees voted to continue the lease agreement with BJC Healthcare through 2015. In 1990 the hospital\'s trustees purchased 24 acres (97,000m2) of land across Broadway in Stephens Park and unveiled an ambitious long-range expansion plan for the existing hospital facility as well as the 24 acres (97,000m2). The first phase of the plan remodeled the front entrance and lobby, created a new out-patient surgery waiting area, cardiac catheterization facilities and a women\'s health center. Medical office buildings were constructed on the property to the north of the hospital, called the Broadway Medical Plaza, and were connected to the hospital by a covered pedestrian walkway that now spanning Broadway. In 2005, the hospital became the first Mid-Missouri facility to receive the Magnet designation from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, and it also was honored as one of the nations top 100 hospitals by Thomson Reuters in 2010.[7] The Nephrology Wound Clinic at BHC received two hyperbaric chambers in 2008. Previously University Hospital had the only hyperbaric chambers in mid-Missouri[8] In 2009 the hospital opened The Spine Center, a specialized-care unit on the fifth floor. The 14,784-square-foot (1,373.5m2) center features 20 private rooms, a room for physical and occupational therapy, a family/relaxation room, a redesigned nurses station and a classroom for pre-operation classes. The project cost $1.8 million and was paid for with hospital operating funds.[9] Boone Hospital Center completed a 940-space parking garage located on the west side of the hospital in 2010 and broke ground on a new seven-story, 128-room patient tower. The entire project, including landscaping along William Street, will cost about $125 million. BHC funded the project by selling $100 million in municipal bonds, and the remaining $25 million will be paid for by funds designated by the hospitals Board of Trustees. The tower is to be finished in spring 2011.[10] In 2010 Boone Hospital Center unveiled the first "high-field" open MRI machine in mid-Missouri. The machine can be used for patients too large to fit into a traditional closed MRI, or who suffer from claustrophobia issues.[11] Boone Hospital operates four ambulances in Boone County. They are located at bases in Centralia, the northeast side of Columbia, and on the Boone Hospital grounds. They, along with the University Hospital ambulance service, provide emergency care for the entire county. Coordinates: 385657N 921856W / 38.94917N 92.31556W / 38.94917; -92.31556'

aS'South Dakota State University is the largest university in the U.S. state of South Dakota, located in Brookings. A public land-grant university and sun grant college, founded under the provisions of the 1862 Morrill Act, SDSU offers programs of study required by, or harmonious to, this Act. In step with this land-grant heritage and mission, SDSU has a special focus on academic programs in agriculture, engineering, nursing, and pharmacy, as well as the liberal arts. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies SDSU as a Research University with high research activity. The graduate program is classified as Doctoral/Science, Technology, Engineering, Math dominant.[2] SDSU is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents, which governs the state\'s six public universities and two special schools. The university was founded on February 21, 1881 as Dakota Agriculture College. The first building, with funding from the territorial legislature, was built in 1883, six years before the State of South Dakota was incorporated. Numerous expansions were funded in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The name was changed in 1904 to South Dakota State College of Agricultural and Mechanic Arts. In 1964, the name was changed to South Dakota State University, reflecting the more comprehensive education offered at the university. In 1923, SDSU\'s instructional program was organized under five divisions: Agriculture, Engineering, General Science, Home Economics, and Pharmacy. In 1956, a Nursing program was established, and in 1957 a formal graduate school was formed. When the University changed its name in 1964, the colleges were renamed Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Home Economics, Nursing, Pharmacy, and the Graduate School. In 1974, the College of General Registration (now the College of General Studies) was formed. In 1975, the Division of Education was created. An Honors College was formed in 1999. Two colleges and seven departments combined in 2009 to create the College of Education and Human Sciences. The current names of these colleges are; Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Education and Human Sciences, Engineering, General Studies, Nursing, Pharmacy, and Honors Colleges and the Graduate School. Wenona Hall and Wecota Hall are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. SDSU awards associate degrees, bachelor\'s degrees, master\'s degrees, and doctoral degrees. Enrollment as of fall 2010 was 12,816. The total enrollment of SDSU has increased each year for the past seven years. The University provides the broadest and most competitive academic programs in the State, with 175 fields of study. The University\'s colleges and schools include the College of Agriculture and Biological Sciences; College of Arts and Sciences; College of Education and Human Sciences; College of Engineering; College of Nursing; College of Pharmacy; the Graduate School; and the Honors College. The following accreditations have been awarded to SDSU: SDSU currently ranks amongst the Midwest\'s top research universities, notably in the fields of agricultural science, biological science, and engineering.[3] It recently made U.S. News and World Report\'s "Top 200 National Universities" in its college and university rankings.[3] Alumni from the university\'s research community have been noted for several scientific achievements, including: SDSU offers a variety of online programs. The university offers associate degrees, bachelor degrees, master degrees, and certificate programs that students can complete online.[9] SDSUs online program earned national recognition on January 10, 2013, when it ranked 2nd overall among online colleges on Guide to Online Schools 2013 Online College Rankings.[10] SDSU\'s athletic mascot for both the men\'s and women\'s teams is the Jackrabbit, Both the men\'s and women\'s sports teams are officially referred to as the Jackrabbits although some fans and media writers (incorrectly) call the women\'s teams "Lady" Jackrabbits or "Lady" Jacks. The homecoming celebration, Hobo Day, is "The Biggest One-Day Event in the Dakotas."[11] The 300+ member SDSU Marching Band, "The Pride of the Dakotas", given the special name the Millennium Band in 2000 by the South Dakota State Legislature, has marched in the 1981 and 1997 Presidential Inaugural Parades in Washington, D.C.; A Capital Fourth in 2000 in Washington DC which was broadcast on PBS; the 2003 and 2008 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California making them the second collegiate band in the history of the Rose Bowl to be invited to march twice when their team was not competing; and the Korean War Monument Dedication at the state\'s capital Pierre in 2004, in the company of two other college bands and 60-some high school bands from across the state. SDSU participates in athletics as a member of NCAA Division I, having completed transition from NCAA Division II by 2009. SDSU\'s athletic conference affiliations include The Summit League for most sports, the Missouri Valley Football Conference (Division I FCS), the Western Wrestling Conference and Varsity Equestrian. The Jackrabbits have 21 varsity sports and numerous intramural and club teams. The women\'s basketball team won the 2003 Division II Championship. In the spring of 2007 and 2008, the Jacks were invited to compete in postseason action in the WNIT. This made them the only transition team (a team that is in the process of being certified for a new division) in WNIT history to do so. In 2007, they received a bye in the first round and continued on to victories over Illinois State and Indiana, but were beaten by the eventual tournament champions, Wyoming, in the 4th round of the tournament.[12] This was an exciting time at SDSU, as their home stadium, Frost Arena, was filled to capacity for both games with the game versus Indiana selling out in a matter of hours. On March 10, 2009, the Jackrabbit women\'s basketball team won the Summit League Championship for the first time and played in their first NCAA Division I Tournament. They beat Texas Christian University in the first round 90-55 but lost to Baylor in the second round 60-58. That season they finished with an overall record of 32-3 and 17-1 in the Summit League. The Jacks women\'s basketball team is led by head coach Aaron Johnston. In 2010, the SDSU women again qualified for the NCAA tournament as a 14 seed, but lost in the first round to Oklahoma, eventual Final Four participant. SDSU finished with a 22-11 (14-4) record. On March 8, 2011, the Jackrabbit women won their third consecutive Summit League Championship, advancing the NCAA tourney for a third straight year. In 2012, the Jackrabbits men\'s and women\'s basketball teams both won Summit League titles, both gaining a berth in the NCAA Tournaments. The Jackrabbit women lost in the opening round of the 2012 tournament to the Purdue Boilermakers. The Jackrabbit men lost in the opening round to the heavily-favored Baylor Bears, a game that was decided only in the final seconds. The Dakota Marker is the trophy awarded to the winner of the annual college football game played between the South Dakota State University (SDSU) Jackrabbits and the North Dakota State University (NDSU) Bison. The trophy is a replica of one of many stone boundary markers that can be found along the border between the states of South Dakota and North Dakota. SDSU won the first Dakota Marker game in Brookings, SD, in 2004. NDSU won the Dakota Marker games held in Fargo, ND, in 2005 and 2006. SDSU won the Dakota Marker in Brookings in 2007 and in 2008 in Fargo as well as at home in Brookings in 2009. In 2009, SDSU made their first ever Division 1 FCS playoff appearance, but lost to eventual Runner-up Montana 61-48 in the first round, SDSU finished with a record of 8-4 and 7-1 in the MVFC. South Dakota State football owns one Great West Conference championship in 2007. South Dakota State recently has released a master plan for renovations in its athletic department. The Dykhouse Student Athlete Center was a starting point for renovations. The Dykhouse is located in the north end-zone of Coughlin Alumni Stadium and was opened in the spring 2010 following the spring football game. Plans are now underway for an indoor practice facility which will include a 300-meter track and an 80-yard practice turf suitable for indoor practice for most sports. Also in the master timeline is expansion of Frost Arena (Basketball) and a replacement 22,500-seat horseshoe football stadium. Students at SDSU have a wide variety of residential hall and apartment living choices. Student housing is located in three areas: the Medary complex located in the northwest corner of campus, consisting of traditional residence halls, Hansen, Waneta and Wecota Annex, and apartment-style living at Meadows North and Meadows South; the Grove complex near the Student Union, consisting of traditional residence halls, Brown, Mathews and Pierson, as well as a newer (2010) variation on the theme of traditional residence halls in Spencer, Thorne and Abbott (also called the Jackrabbit Village); and the Larson complex on the east side of campus, consisting of traditional halls Binnewies and Young and suite living at Caldwell Hall. All of the residence halls with the exception of Caldwell are co-ed by wing, with each wing having its own bathroom. Caldwell Hall is suite style, meaning two rooms share a common bathroom for the four occupants and each floor on Caldwell is co-ed. The Meadows North and Meadows South apartment complexes feature four-bedroom apartments. In addition to the Medary, Grove and Larson complexes for single students, SDSU has 80 one-bedroom apartments and eight two-bedroom apartments available for rent for married students in State Court and State Village. State Court and State Village are located on the southeast side of campus. Some residence halls have a Living/Learning Community, where an entire floor is composed of a certain group of students. Examples include Agriculture and Biology Majors, Honors College, Engineering House, Health Professionals House and Substance-Free. Furniture in the halls except Wecota Annex, is moveable and the provided beds may be loftedstudents do not need to purchase or bring their own loft. Residents may also contract phone and cable services with the appropriate companies. Washers and dryers are available in all the halls and operate with either cash or by using campus Hobo Dough. Ground-breaking took place in the Spring of 2012 for four residence halls similar to the Jackrabbit Village halls (Spencer, Thorne and Abbott). Completion of the four new halls (called Jackrabbit Grove and to be named later) is expected by Fall of 2013. On January 1, 2007, David Chicoine became the 19th President of South Dakota State University.

aS"Joseph Fernand Leon Rochefort (born May 4, 1939 in Cap-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec) is a retired Canadian professional ice hockey centerman who spent 15 seasons in the National Hockey League playing for seven clubs. A hard-working journeyman, he helped the Montreal Canadiens win the Stanley Cup in 1966 and 1971. Rochefort came up through the junior system of the New York Rangers, playing for the Guelph Biltmores alongside future Hall of Famers Rod Gilbert and Jean Ratelle. He turned pro in 1959, and made his NHL debut in 196061 appearing in a single game for the Rangers. In 196263, he appeared in 23 games for the Rangers, recording 5 goals and 9 points. Prior to the 196364 campaign, Rochefort was dealt to the Montreal Canadiens in a seven-player trade involving star goaltenders Jacques Plante and Gump Worsley. He would find it difficult to crack the powerful Montreal roster, spending most of the next three years with the Quebec Aces of the American Hockey League and appearing in just 11 games in Montreal over that span. However, he was called up to the team for the 1966 playoffs and appeared in 4 games, recording a goal and an assist, as Montreal won the Stanley Cup. He would build on that success the following year, spending most of the 196667 season in Montreal, notching 9 goals and 7 assists in 27 games. Rochefort was claimed by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft, and in Philadelphia was finally able to establish himself as a full-time NHL player. He would have his finest NHL season in 196768, leading the Flyers with 21 goals and finishing 3rd in overall scoring with 42 points. He would have another solid year in 196869, finishing 5th on Philadelphia with 35 points, but was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings at the conclusion of the season in a deal for enforcer Reggie Fleming. He spent a single season in Los Angeles, and led the team in assists although the team struggled to a last-place finish. For the 197071 season, Rochefort was re-acquired by the Canadiens. He finished the year with just 5 goals and was briefly dispatched to the AHL, but appeared in 10 playoff games as Montreal again won the Stanley Cup. Following the season, he was dealt to the Detroit Red Wings, where he had a bounce-back year to finish with 17 goals and 28 points. Early in the 197273 season, he was dealt again, this time to the expansion Atlanta Flames where he would be a stabilizing influence in the team's first two NHL seasons. Prior to the 197475 season, Rochefort was sold to the Vancouver Canucks, who would be his seventh NHL team. At the age of 35, he turned in one of the best seasons of his career, notching 18 goals - good for 5th on the team - and 29 points, and was a valuable veteran influence on a Canuck team which would win their division for the first time in their history. However, he was sent to the minors after a sluggish start to the following year, and he retired from the sport in 1976. Rochefort finished his career with totals of 121 goals and 147 assists for 268 points in 617 NHL games, along with just 93 penalty minutes. Rochefort is the uncle of Normand Rochefort, who spent 13 seasons as an NHL defender between 1980 and 1994."

aS'Gyro\'s First Invention is a Gyro Gearloose story by Don Rosa that also features Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie. It is a 50th anniversary story for the character of Gyro Gearloose, as well as a sequel to A Christmas for Shacktown (Dell One Shot #367, January 1952) by Carl Barks, and tells of the creation of Gyro\'s Little Helper. Its INDUCKS story code is D 2001-143 [1]. It first appeared in May 2002 as a two-part story in the issues #19 and #20 of Anders And & Co, a weekly published by Danish Disney licensee Egmont Group. Its first publication in its original English was in Uncle Scrooge #324, November 2003, by Gemstone Publishing. Donald tells his nephews the story about how Gyro started his business despite the fact this his nephews were there. The story starts when Scrooge was still living with Donald and his nephews. Scrooge and Donald got into an argument which led to Scrooge breaking Donald\'s lamp. Donald took the lamp to get repaired by Fulton Gearloose but unfortunately Donald finds out that Fulton has just retired and turned the shop over to his son Gyro. Gyro agreed to fix Donald\'s lamp but Donald suggested that he should find a way to get Scrooge\'s Money out of the cavern that it was stuck in. Scrooge and Donald showed Gyro where the money was kept and explained the situation. When they went back to Gyro\'s shop he asked someone to turn on the light but the lamp turned itself on. The lamp was hit by the unfinished think box that Gyro accidentally hit earlier. Gyro modified the lamp to have arms and legs and doll shoes and Donald put in a lightbulb and they created Gyro\'s Little Helper. Gyro\'s Little Helper went in the cavern and found some money. They found out how deep the cavern is and pumped up some helium gas into the cavern as the money slowly went back up to the Money Bin. Unfortunately the gas worked too well as it made the Money Bin float into the air. Little Helper used his head to break the plastic cover to let the gas out and The Money Bin wound up on the statue of Cornelius Coot. Scrooge called for some rescue plans to his Money Bin off the statue. The Construction workers covered the hole with cement and gravel and The Money Bin was restored to its original location. After that Gyro and his Little Helper cleaned up Gyro\'s Workshop. Donald let Gyro keep Little Helper alive despite the fact that it was made from his lamp. The story ends with Gyro and Little Helper trying to sell inventions as Donald finishes telling the nephews his story. Don Rosa is usually hesitant in using ideas that fans send him, because he knows that neither can he ever pay them for their ideas, nor is Disney ever likely to do so. Gyro\'s First Invention is special in that Rosa accepted a number of its key elements that were offered to him by Sigvald Grsfjeld Jr., owner and maintainer of the Norwegian Rosa fansite The D.U.C.K.man.[1][2] (Another notable exception is The Dream of a Lifetime! that Rosa created based on an idea by an anonymous fan from France only known by the initials F.S.M.) In his research for his website, Grsfjeld had come upon newsgroup exchanges between Rosa and his fans regarding "the problem of the lost money in A Christmas for Shacktown". In that classic Duck story by Carl Barks, Scrooge eventually loses all his money in an underground cave below his money bin, and the only access he has to it is by means of a little toy train (any other means would make the cave collapse and have Scrooge\'s money irretrievably fall into a reservoir of quicksand just below), bringing him a mere handful of coins and bills back on every trip in and out of the cave, which makes it clear for the characters at the end of the story that it will take Scrooge several hundreds years to regain his entire "three cubic acres of money". However, upon Scrooge\'s next appearances in the one-pager Osogood Silver Polish and the long adventure story Only a Poor Old Man (both in Dell One Shot #386, March 1952) he has somehow, magically relocated all his fortunes back into the bin, a mystery for which Barks had never given an explanation. On 11 January 1999, Grsfjeld sent Rosa an e-mail containing his thoughts he had for a potential sequel to A Christmas for Shacktown:[2] "Somewhere you say that many fans and several editors for many years have asked you to do a sequel to the old Barks classic A Christmas for Shacktown (1951), where you were supposed to tell how $crooge managed to save his money from the deep pit much faster than he thought in the end of that story. [...] Anyway, I think that [...] it would be interesting to see an explanation of that mystery. If you ever decide to do that story (I know you like sequels) I have some ideas: My idea is that, the problems $crooge faces in the end of A Christmas for Shacktown cries out for a GEARLOOSE-MIRACLE. Perhaps this story thus could also show the first meeting between $crooge and Gyro? ...perhaps this could be a possible story for the first future [50th] Gyro-anniversary?" - Sigvald Grsfjeld Jr., e-mail to Don Rosa, 11 January 1999 Rosa immediately replied to Grsfjeld the very next day, 12 January 1999:[2] "That is a great story idea!!! I love it! I need to check when the first Gyro story appeared in WDC&S, but if Christmas for Shacktown predates it, that is a GREAT idea! They want me to do a Christmas story AND a sequel to that story AND they will probably ask me to do a 50th anniversary Gyro story! I am going to write this idea down *immediately*!" - Don Rosa, e-mail to Sigvald Grsfjeld Jr., 12 January 1999 Yet another day later, Grsfjeld had a few details worked out for Rosa:[2] "For some reason, Gyro [...] need[s] a little device to enter the pit the same way [...] [Huey, Dewey, and Louie]\'s train did (reasons could be to get him/them samples of the soil in there, to help him/them drawing a detailed map of the situation inside the pit, or perhaps to install some other devices in there). However this little device must be able to do much more than could that train. The solution for this? A small MICROBOT created out of whatever he/they find in the workshop." - Sigvald Grsfjeld Jr., e-mail to Don Rosa, 13 January 1999'

aS"The Kzuke-Musashi campaign was a rapid and direct assault during the Japanese Genk War by Nitta Yoshisada that led up to the Siege of Kamakura in 1333. It consisted of a number of battles over a brief period.[1] The ultimate result was the ending of the Kamakura Shogunate. By the first part of the 14th century, the Kamakura Shogunate, which had never fully recovered from successfully fending off the Mongol Invasions, was already engaging a resurgent imperial house under Go-Daigo during the Genk War. Go-Daigo's son Prince Morinaga energetically organized an uprising against the Hj recruiting a number of the key martial leaders that supported the Emperor including Kusunoki Masashige. Early in 1333 Morninaga and Kusunoki, the latter being entrenched at Chihaya, were the targets of a large army sent from Kamakura to destroy the uprising. This left Kamakura relatively undefended.[2] Nitta Yoshisada, who was originally supporting the Hojo Regents of Kamakura, was convinced to support the imperial cause.[3] From his home base in Kzuke Province, Nitta and a group of other nobles including his brother Yoshisuke took advantage of the lightly defended Kamakura and entered Musashi Province in force. Following the important Kamakura Kaid highway, Nitta's army received fresh recruits along the way from local powerful clans and repeatedly engaged the Hojo forces until reaching the outskirts of Kamakura, thus beginning the Siege of Kamakura.[4] Nitta's forces entered Musashi from Kzuke and joined the Kamakura Kaid at Sugaya. The principle battles were:"

aS'The National anthem of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes 19181929) was created in December 1918 from the national anthems of the Kingdom\'s main three constituent historical provinces: Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. In those times the official authorities considered the three nations, Croats, Serbs and Slovenes as one nation with three names. The official language was thus called the Serbo-Croato-Slovene language. Although a law on the national anthem did not exist, the anthems of all three South Slavic nations were unified into a single anthem of the Kingdom. It started with a few measures from the Serbian anthem "Boe pravde", continued with a few lines from the Croatian anthem "Lijepa naa domovino", which were in turn followed by a few lines from the traditional Slovenian anthem "Naprej zastava slave". The anthem finished with some lines from the Serbian anthem again. It was officially used between 1919 and 1941. There was no official document that declared the anthem invalid, or void. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was not in effect after the April capitulation. The third line of the last verse was changed to "Kralja Aleksandra, Boe hrani," during the reign of Alexander I of Yugoslavia. The third line of the last verse was changed to "King Aleksandar, God protect" during the reign of Alexander I of Yugoslavia.  '

aS'The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History is a book about the American animated television series The Simpsons. It was written by John Ortved, and first published in October 2009 by Faber and Faber. In the United Kingdom, the book is called Simpsons Confidential: The uncensored, totally unauthorised history of the world\'s greatest TV show by the people that made it.[2] The book is an oral history of the show, and concentrates particularly on the writers and producers of the show. The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as creator Matt Groening and James L. Brooks and Sam Simon, who helped develop the series. According to National Public Radio reviewer Linda Holmes, "Ortved\'s thesis, essentially, is that lots of people are responsible for the success of The Simpsons, and their creator, Matt Groening, has too often been viewed as the sole source to the detriment of others who also deserve to be praised."[3] In 2007, John Ortved wrote an article for Vanity Fair titled "Simpson Family Values". Producers of the show, including Groening, Brooks and Simon, chose not to cooperate in the project. Ortved believes that the reason was because "were upset [that] the myth of The Simpsons would be challenged."[4] Shortly after the article was published, an agent suggested that Ortved write a full book. The producers again decided not to participate, and, according to Ortved, Brooks asked current and former Simpsons employees not to talk to Ortved. However, the book does include portions of interviews that several figures did with other sources. Ortved did interview a number of sources for the book, including Hank Azaria, a cast member of the show since the second season, Fox Broadcasting Company owner Rupert Murdoch and former writer Conan O\'Brien. Reviews of the book were mostly positive, with most reviewers commenting that the book was well researched and provided a solid history of the show. Critics felt that the final chapters, in which Ortved gives his opinion of the current state of the show, were out of place and did not fit in with the rest of the book. In 2007, John Ortved wrote an article for Vanity Fair titled "Simpson Family Values". It was an oral history of The Simpsons, featuring interviews with several of the crew and cast members.[5] According to Ortved, the producers of The Simpsons decided not to cooperate and be interviewed for the project because they had heard that he was asking questions about Sam Simon. Simon, one of the first executive producers of the show, had left after the fourth season after clashing with creator Matt Groening and executive producer James L. Brooks.[4] Ortved believes that the producers "were upset [that] the myth of The Simpsons would be challenged."[4] He still wrote the story, without the approval of the Simpsons producers.[6] Shortly after the article was published, an agent suggested that Ortved write a full book.[7] They put together a proposal and shopped it to several publishers, before being signed by Faber and Faber.[7] According to Ortved, "When word of this got out, Brooks sent a letter to every current Simpsons employee, and all the former ones he thought mattered, asking them not to speak to me. The writers agents sent denial after denial for interview requests and eventually stopped responding altogether."[6] He added, "There was one \'D\'oh!\' in James L. Brooks and the Gracie Films master plan: Many people dont like James L. Brooks. [...] The book I ended up writing quotes more than 75 sourcessome of them Simpsons staffers, former and current, who opened up because they considered his and Matt Groenings attempt to stomp on my project very \'un-Simpsons.\'"[6] Ortved decided to write the book as an oral history because he found that every person interviewed had a different perspective on the events. His decision was "reinforced" when he found out that the producers of the show would not cooperate.[7] The Simpsons did not spring out of one man\'s brain, fully formed, like a hilarious Athena. Its inception was a process, and it has more than one parent (as well as stepparents, grandparents, creepy uncles, and ungrateful children). According to National Public Radio reviewer Linda Holmes, "Ortved\'s thesis, essentially, is that lots of people are responsible for the success of The Simpsons, and their creator, Matt Groening, has too often been viewed as the sole source to the detriment of others who also deserve to be praised."[3] The Simpsons: An Uncensored, Unauthorized History is an oral history of the show, examining its beginnings, rise to success, impact on pop culture, as well as the people behind the show, including the animators, writers and producers. The content consists mostly of quotations from various figures, which are tied together by comments from Ortved. The book includes entire chapters devoted to key figures such as Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Sam Simon and Conan O\'Brien.[9] The book\'s foreword was written by Canadian author Douglas Coupland.[10] The final chapters of the book consist mostly of commentary from Ortved, in which he states that he believes that quality of the show has declined since its early years.[11] Ortved interviewed a number of sources for the book, including main cast member Hank Azaria,[12] former director Brad Bird,[9] former supervising director Gbor Csup[7] and former writer O\'Brien.[13] Groening, Brooks and Simon refused to participate in the book, or be interviewed by Ortved.[13] However, the book does include portions of interviews that they did with other sources.[7] According to Ortved, most of the participants "had stories to tell, or axes to grind," or are "too successful to care."[9] Research and interviews for both the book and Vanity Fair article were conducted between January 2007 and May 2008.[7] Ortved commented that the person he most would have liked to interview was Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson.[14] Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the Fox Broadcasting Company, agreed to be interviewed, and reportedly told Ortved "Those creative types, they\'re always looking to pick a fight."[15] He also interviewed figures such as Fox CEO Barry Diller[12] and guest stars Ricky Gervais,[15] Art Spiegelman[16] and Tom Wolfe.[9] Reviews of the book were mostly positive. Linda Holmes of National Public Radio felt that "most of Ortved\'s work provides a solid basic history."[3] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the book a "B+", writing, "you have to admire all the work that went into this unauthorized history." He noted that he "felt a little bad afterward for the central players who got sucker punched. [...] The subsequent testimony about the empire Groening created is contentious and mesmerizing. It\'s also conflicting and compromised, since some of the biggest fishies of all did not talk to Ortved. [...] The reader should be wary when sources assert that Groening is little more than an affable frontman for the show or that Brooks sometimes wielded his power imperiously: The guys aren\'t there to defend themselves. In most cases, though, Ortved amasses quotes from many sources to establish such points, so the negative stuff doesn\'t seem gratuitous."[16] Michael C. Lorah of Newsarama described the book as a "very effective, very worthwhile read" but felt that Ortved\'s "editorializing" was "probably the most distracting element of the book."[17] Michael Hingston of See Magazine called the book "a well-told patchwork that shines formidable light on the show" and gave it three and a half stars. However, he felt the book was released prematurely and should have been published after the end of the show, also criticizing Ortved\'s narration and the lack of quotes from Matt Groening or James L. Brooks.[18] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club pointed out that the book has "numerous factual errors" that "may only trip the alarms of hardcore fans, but even casual readers may be put off by the book\'s redundancy." He concluded that despite flaws, the "insight into its routines and eccentric personalities can\'t help but fascinate."[19] Ryan Bigge of The Toronto Star felt that Ortved\'s "diligence and research is faultless, and [he] has worked hard to avoid writing another insider-y true-fans-only look at the show. Still, certain chunks of the book are unlikely to appeal to casual Simpsons viewers. [..] By mixing journalism about yellow people with a bit of yellow journalism, Ortved provides a tough, necessary look at Homer Simpson\'s odyssey that would make Kent Brockman proud."[20] Bryan Appleyard of The Sunday Times criticized the format of the book, writing that it was "alternately engrossing and infuriating book [...] It is infuriating because of a fatal structural decision taken by the author and/or his publisher to include long quotations from interviewees as breaks in the text. This destroys narrative coherence and, for much of the time, makes reading a chore." Appleyard concluded that it is "an important and controversial contribution to the ever-expanding scope of Simpsons studies."[21] Several critics felt that the final chapters, in which Ortved gives his opinion of the current state of the show, were out of place when compared with the rest of the book.[3] Ken Tucker felt Ortved\'s "complaints aren\'t original or illuminating."[16] Linda Holmes wrote that "After spending most of the book using actual reporting to flesh out the facts, Ortved largely turns the floor over to himself for the part of the book in which he describes the creative decline of the show and tries to figure out whose fault it is by not infrequently simply declaring, among other things, which episodes are good and which are bad, sometimes without explaining himself at all."[3] Michael C. Lorah felt that Ortved\'s criticism of the later seasons was "disconcerting", noting that "It\'s not that he\'s wrong, but it seems unnecessary and at times even petty when cast against his own fawning over the undeniably massive influence of the show on current pop culture and comedy."[17]'

Duffy was on the Republican slate of the 10 Wisconsin electors for the 2008 Presidential Election.[13] On July 8, 2009, Duffy announced his campaign for Congress in Wisconsin\'s seventh congressional district. Duffy was considered an underdog in the race until May 2010 when 15-term incumbent Democrat Representative Dave Obey announced that he would not seek re-election.[14] Following Obey\'s announcement, Democratic State Senator Julie Lassa joined the race. On June 4, 2010, Duffy announced his resignation from the position of District Attorney of Ashland County to focus on the congressional race. The resignation was effective three weeks later and Duffy returned to work in his father\'s law practice.[15] He won the race on November 2, 2010, in a nationwide wave of Republicans being elected to Congress.[16] Different sources attribute his victory to his ten month head start on Lassa\'s campaign, his grassroots organization and fundraising, his experience as a district attorney, and voter discontent with the economy.[17] Duffy was challenged by Democratic nominee Pat Kreitlow. Duffy has voted with his party 91% of the time.[18] On March 17, 2011, Duffy was one of only seven Republicans who voted "No" on a House bill that would strip all government funding from National Public Radio.[19] He also voted against the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act.[20] The first piece of legislation he sponsored was the RESET Act, which called for using unspent money in Obama\'s economic stimulus plan to pay down the debt. The idea was later incorporated into a spending bill. He also introduced a resolution to ban earmarks. One of his sponsored legislation, to reform the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, passed the U.S. House but hasn\'t passed the U.S. Senate.[20] The bill created a bipartisan commission made up of five members of Congress to replace the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director. The bill also gave the committee more room to get rid of polices that Duffy believes jeopardize the safety of the US banking system.[21] In March 2011, Duffy caused controversy when a video published by the Polk County Republicans, showing a public town hall-style meeting in his district, was removed after critics attacked the video. In the video, made in the wake of the passage of a controversial state bill which would have effectively frozen the salaries of state employees, Duffy was asked about whether he would be willing to cut his own $174,000 salary. Duffy responded that he would only be willing to do so as part of a general round of salary cuts for government employees, and insisted that he was "struggling" to get by, despite his salary being nearly three times the average for Wisconsin residents.[22] The video has since been published in other locations.[23][24][25][26][27] From February to October 2011, Duffy voted yes on three different bills to approve limits on funding for abortion. The bills were: 1) Amends Federal Health Care Law to Prohibit Abortion Coverage; 2) Prohibiting Taxpayer Funding of Abortion; 3) Prohibiting Use of Federal Funds For Planned Parenthood.[28] Duffy cosponsored the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act and the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act.[29] While the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act is presented by pro-life advocates as a straightforward bill intending to stop federal dollars from going to fund abortions, pro-choice advocates say that federal funding of abortion is already prohibited, and the bill\'s true intent is to restrict insurance coverage for and decrease access to abortions.[30] On December 22, 2011, Duffy and fellow GOP House freshman Rick Crawford (Arkansas), published an open letter to Speaker Boehner, urging the leader to allow the House to vote on the Senate\'s 2-month tax cut extension compromise.[31] Duffy serves on the Committee on Financial Services, in particular the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and the Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity.[32] Duffy is married to Rachel Campos-Duffy, an alumna of The Real World: San Francisco.[33][34][35] They once lived in Ashland, Wisconsin.[36][37] and moved to Weston, Wisconsin in late 2011.[38] They have six children: Evita Pilar, Xavier Jack, Lucia-Belen, John-Paul, Paloma Pilar and MariaVictoria Margarita.[39][40]'

aS'David Herbert Lawrence (11 September 1885  2 March 1930) was an English novelist, poet, playwright, essayist, literary critic and painter who published as D. H. Lawrence. His collected works represent an extended reflection upon the dehumanising effects of modernity and industrialisation. In them, Lawrence confronts issues relating to emotional health and vitality, spontaneity, and instinct. Lawrence\'s opinions earned him many enemies and he endured official persecution, censorship, and misrepresentation of his creative work throughout the second half of his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile which he called his "savage pilgrimage."[4] At the time of his death, his public reputation was that of a pornographer who had wasted his considerable talents. E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as, "The greatest imaginative novelist of our generation."[5] Later, the influential Cambridge critic F. R. Leavis championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness, placing much of Lawrence\'s fiction within the canonical "great tradition" of the English novel. Lawrence is now valued by many as a visionary thinker and significant representative of modernism in English literature. The fourth child of Arthur John Lawrence, a barely literate miner, and Lydia (ne Beardsall), a former pupil teacher who, owing to her family\'s financial difficulties, had to do manual work in a lace factory.[6] Lawrence spent his formative years in the coal mining town of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. The house in which he was born, in Eastwood, 8a Victoria Street, is now the D.H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum.[7] His working-class background and the tensions between his parents provided the raw material for a number of his early works. Lawrence would return to this locality and often wrote about nearby Underwood, calling it; "the country of my heart,"[8] as a setting for much of his fiction. The young Lawrence attended Beauvale Board School (now renamed Greasley Beauvale D. H. Lawrence Primary School in his honour) from 1891 until 1898, becoming the first local pupil to win a County Council scholarship to Nottingham High School in nearby Nottingham. He left in 1901, working for three months as a junior clerk at Haywood\'s surgical appliances factory, but a severe bout of pneumonia, reportedly the result of being accosted by a group of factory girls (as detailed by school friend, George Neville), ended this career. Whilst convalescing he often visited Hagg\'s Farm, the home of the Chambers family, and began a friendship with Jessie Chambers. An important aspect of this relationship with Chambers and other adolescent acquaintances was a shared love of books, an interest that lasted throughout Lawrence\'s life. In the years 1902 to 1906 Lawrence served as a pupil teacher at the British School, Eastwood. He went on to become a full-time student and received a teaching certificate from University College, Nottingham, in 1908. During these early years he was working on his first poems, some short stories, and a draft of a novel, Laetitia, that was eventually to become The White Peacock. At the end of 1907 he won a short story competition in the Nottingham Guardian, the first time that he had gained any wider recognition for his literary talents. In the autumn of 1908 the newly qualified Lawrence left his childhood home for London. While teaching in Davidson Road School, Croydon, he continued writing. Some of the early poetry, submitted by Jessie Chambers, came to the attention of Ford Madox Ford, then known as Ford Hermann Hueffer and editor of the influential The English Review. Hueffer then commissioned the story Odour of Chrysanthemums which, when published in that magazine, encouraged Heinemann, a London publisher, to ask Lawrence for more work. His career as a professional author now began in earnest, although he taught for a further year. Shortly after the final proofs of his first published novel The White Peacock appeared in 1910, Lawrence\'s mother died. She had been ill with cancer. The young man was devastated and he was to describe the next few months as his "sick year." It is clear that Lawrence had an extremely close relationship with his mother and his grief following her death became a major turning point in his life, just as the death of Mrs. Morel forms a major turning point in his autobiographical novel Sons and Lovers, a work that draws upon much of the writer\'s provincial upbringing. In 1911 Lawrence was introduced to Edward Garnett, a publisher\'s reader, who acted as a mentor, provided further encouragement, and became a valued friend, as Garnett\'s son David was also. Throughout these months the young author revised Paul Morel, the first draft of what became Sons and Lovers. In addition, a teaching colleague, Helen Corke, gave him access to her intimate diaries about an unhappy love affair, which formed the basis of The Trespasser, his second novel. In November 1911, he came down with a pneumonia again; once he recovered, Lawrence decided to abandon teaching in order to become a full-time author. He also broke off an engagement to Louie Burrows, an old friend from his days in Nottingham and Eastwood. In March 1912 Lawrence met Frieda Weekley (ne von Richthofen), with whom he was to share the rest of his life. She was six years older than her new lover, married to Lawrence\'s former modern languages professor from University College, Nottingham, Ernest Weekley, and with three young children. She eloped with Lawrence to her parents\' home in Metz, a garrison town then in Germany near the disputed border with France. Their stay here included Lawrence\'s first encounter with tensions between Germany and France, when he was arrested and accused of being a British spy, before being released following an intervention from Frieda Weekley\'s father. After this encounter Lawrence left for a small hamlet to the south of Munich, where he was joined by Weekley for their "honeymoon", later memorialised in the series of love poems titled Look! We Have Come Through (1917). 1912 also saw the first of Lawrence\'s so-called "mining plays", The Daughter-in-Law, written in Nottingham dialect. The play was never to be performed, or even published, in Lawrence\'s lifetime. From Germany they walked southwards across the Alps to Italy, a journey that was recorded in the first of his travel books, a collection of linked essays titled Twilight in Italy and the unfinished novel, Mr Noon. During his stay in Italy, Lawrence completed the final version of Sons and Lovers that, when published in 1913, was acknowledged to represent a vivid portrait of the realities of working class provincial life. Lawrence though, had become so tired of the work that he allowed Edward Garnett to cut about a hundred pages from the text. Lawrence and Frieda returned to Britain in 1913 for a short visit. At this time, he now encountered and befriended critic John Middleton Murry and New Zealand-born short story writer Katherine Mansfield. Lawrence was able to meet with Welsh tramp poet W. H. Davies whose work, much of which was inspired by nature, he much admired. Davies had begun to collect autographs and was particularly keen to obtain Lawrence\'s. Georgian poetry publisher Edward Marsh was able to secure an autograph (probably as part of a signed poem) and also invited Lawrence and Frieda to meet Davies in London on 28 July, under his supervision. Lawrence was immediately captivated by the poet and later invited Davies to join Frieda and him in Germany. Despite his early enthusiasm for Davies\' work, however, Lawrence\'s opinion changed after reading Foliage and he commented after reading Nature Poems in Italy that they seemed ".. so thin, one can hardly feel them".[9] Lawrence and Weekley soon went back to Italy, staying in a cottage in Fiascherino on the Gulf of Spezia. Here he started writing the first draft of a work of fiction that was to be transformed into two of his better-known novels, The Rainbow and Women in Love. While writing Women in Love in Cornwall during 191617, Lawrence developed a strong and possibly romantic relationship with a Cornish farmer named William Henry Hocking.[10] Although it is not absolutely clear if their relationship was sexual, Lawrence\'s wife, Frieda Weekley, said she believed it was. Lawrence\'s fascination with themes of homosexuality could also be related to his own sexual orientation. This theme is also overtly manifested in Women in Love. Indeed, in a letter written during 1913, he writes, "I should like to know why nearly every man that approaches greatness tends to homosexuality, whether he admits it or not..."[11] He is also quoted as saying, "I believe the nearest I\'ve come to perfect love was with a young coal-miner when I was about 16."[12] Eventually, Weekley obtained her divorce. The couple returned to Britain shortly before the outbreak of World War I and were married on 13 July 1914. In this time, Lawrence worked with London intellectuals and writers such as Dora Marsden and the people involved with The Egoist (T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and others). The Egoist, an important Modernist literary magazine, published some of his work. He was also reading and adapting Marinetti\'s Futurist Manifesto.[13] He also met at this time the young Jewish artist Mark Gertler, and they became for a time good friends; Lawrence would describe Gertler\'s 1916 anti-war painting, \'The Merry-Go-Round\' as \'the best modern picture I have seen: I think it is great and true.\'[14] Gertler would inspire the character Loerke (a sculptor) in Women in Love. Weekley\'s German parentage and Lawrence\'s open contempt for militarism meant that they were viewed with suspicion in wartime Britain and lived in near destitution. The Rainbow (1915) was suppressed after an investigation into its alleged obscenity in 1915. Later, they were accused of spying and signalling to German submarines off the coast of Cornwall where they lived at Zennor. During this period he finished Women in Love. In it Lawrence explores the destructive features of contemporary civilization through the evolving relationships of four major characters as they reflect upon the value of the arts, politics, economics, sexual experience, friendship and marriage. This book is a bleak, bitter vision of humanity and proved impossible to publish in wartime conditions. Not published until 1920, it is now widely recognised as an English novel of great dramatic force and intellectual subtlety. In late 1917, after constant harassment by the armed forces authorities, Lawrence was forced to leave Cornwall at three days\' notice under the terms of the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA). This persecution was later described in an autobiographical chapter of his Australian novel Kangaroo, published in 1923. He spent some months in early 1918 in the small, rural village of Hermitage near Newbury, Berkshire. He then lived for just under a year (mid-1918 to early 1919) at Mountain Cottage, Middleton-by-Wirksworth, Derbyshire, where he wrote one of his most poetic short stories, The White Peacock. Until 1919 he was compelled by poverty to shift from address to address and barely survived a severe attack of influenza. After the traumatic experience of the war years, Lawrence began what he termed his \'savage pilgrimage\', a time of voluntary exile. He escaped from Britain at the earliest practical opportunity, to return only twice for brief visits, and with his wife spent the remainder of his life travelling. This wanderlust took him to Australia, Italy, Ceylon (now called Sri Lanka), the United States, Mexico and the South of France. Lawrence abandoned Britain in November 1919 and headed south, first to the Abruzzi region in central Italy and then onwards to Capri and the Fontana Vecchia in Taormina, Sicily. From Sicily he made brief excursions to Sardinia, Monte Cassino, Malta, Northern Italy, Austria and Southern Germany. Many of these places appeared in his writings. New novels included The Lost Girl (for which he won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction), Aaron\'s Rod and the fragment titled Mr Noon (the first part of which was published in the Phoenix anthology of his works, and the entirety in 1984). He experimented with shorter novels or novellas, such as The Captain\'s Doll, The Fox and The Ladybird. In addition, some of his short stories were issued in the collection England, My England and Other Stories. During these years he produced a number of poems about the natural world in Birds, Beasts and Flowers. Lawrence is widely recognised as one of the finest travel writers in the English language. Sea and Sardinia, a book that describes a brief journey undertaken in January 1921, is a recreation of the life of the inhabitants of Sardinia.[15] Less well known is the brilliant memoir of Maurice Magnus, Memoirs of the Foreign Legion, in which Lawrence recalls his visit to the monastery of Monte Cassino. Other non-fiction books include two responses to Freudian psychoanalysis and Movements in European History, a school textbook that was published under a pseudonym, a reflection of his blighted reputation in Britain. In late February 1922 the Lawrences left Europe behind with the intention of migrating to the United States. They sailed in an easterly direction, first to Ceylon and then on to Australia. A short residence in Darlington, Western Australia, which included an encounter with local writer Mollie Skinner, was followed by a brief stop in the small coastal town of Thirroul, New South Wales, during which Lawrence completed Kangaroo, a novel about local fringe politics that also revealed a lot about his wartime experiences in Cornwall. The Lawrences finally arrived in the US in September 1922. Here they encountered Mabel Dodge Luhan, a prominent socialite, and considered establishing a utopian community on what was then known as the 160-acre (0.65km2) Kiowa Ranch near Taos, New Mexico. After arriving in Lamy, New Mexico, via train, they acquired the property, now called the D. H. Lawrence Ranch, in 1924 in exchange for the manuscript of Sons and Lovers. He stayed in New Mexico for two years, with extended visits to Lake Chapala and Oaxaca in Mexico. While Lawrence was in New Mexico, he was visited by Aldous Huxley. While in the U.S., Lawrence rewrote and published Studies in Classic American Literature, a set of critical essays begun in 1917, and later described by Edmund Wilson as "one of the few first-rate books that have ever been written on the subject." These interpretations, with their insights into symbolism, New England Transcendentalism and the puritan sensibility, were a significant factor in the revival of the reputation of Herman Melville during the early 1920s. In addition, Lawrence completed a number of new fictional works, including The Boy in the Bush, The Plumed Serpent, St Mawr, The Woman who Rode Away, The Princess and assorted short stories. He also found time to produce some more travel writing, such as the collection of linked excursions that became Mornings in Mexico. A brief voyage to England at the end of 1923 was a failure and he soon returned to Taos, convinced that his life as an author now lay in America. However, in March 1925 he suffered a near fatal attack of malaria and tuberculosis while on a third visit to Mexico. Although he eventually recovered, the diagnosis of his condition obliged him to return once again to Europe. He was dangerously ill and the poor health limited his ability to travel for the remainder of his life. The Lawrences made their home in a villa in Northern Italy, living near Florence while he wrote The Virgin and the Gipsy and the various versions of Lady Chatterley\'s Lover (1928). The latter book, his last major novel, was initially published in private editions in Florence and Paris and reinforced his notoriety. Lawrence responded robustly to those who claimed to be offended, penning a large number of satirical poems, published under the title of "Pansies" and "Nettles", as well as a tract on Pornography and Obscenity. The return to Italy allowed Lawrence to renew old friendships; during these years he was particularly close to Aldous Huxley, who was to edit the first collection of Lawrence\'s letters after his death, along with a memoir. With artist Earl Brewster, Lawrence visited a number of local archaeological sites in April 1927. The resulting essays describing these visits to old tombs were written up and collected together as Sketches of Etruscan Places, a book that contrasts the lively past with Benito Mussolini\'s fascism. Lawrence continued to produce fiction, including short stories and The Escaped Cock (also published as The Man Who Died), an unorthodox reworking of the story of Jesus Christ\'s Resurrection. During these final years Lawrence renewed a serious interest in oil painting. Official harassment persisted and an exhibition of some of these pictures at the Warren Gallery in London was raided by the police in mid 1929 and a number of works were confiscated. Nine of the Lawrence oils have been on permanent display in the La Fonda Hotel in Taos[16] since shortly after Frieda\'s death. They hang in a small gallery just off the main lobby and are available for viewing. Lawrence continued to write despite his failing health. In his last months he wrote numerous poems, reviews and essays, as well as a robust defence of his last novel against those who sought to suppress it. His last significant work was a reflection on the Book of Revelation, Apocalypse. After being discharged from a sanatorium, he died at the Villa Robermond in Vence, France, from complications of tuberculosis. Frieda Weekley commissioned an elaborate headstone for his grave bearing a mosaic of his adopted emblem of the phoenix.[17] After Lawrence\'s death, Frieda married Angelo Ravagli. She returned to live on the ranch in Taos and later her third husband brought Lawrence\'s ashes to be interred there in a small chapel set amid the mountains of New Mexico. The headstone has recently been donated to D. H. Lawrence Heritage and is now on display in the D.H. Lawrence Birthplace Museum in his home town of Eastwood, Nottinghamshire. Critic and admirer Terry Eagleton situates Lawrence on the radical right wing, as hostile to democracy, liberalism, socialism, and egalitarianism, though never actually embracing fascism.[18] Some of Lawrence\'s beliefs can be seen in his letters to Bertrand Russell around the year 1915, where he voices his opposition to enfranchising the working class, his hostility to the burgeoning labour movements, and disparages the French Revolution, referring to "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" as the "three-fanged serpent." Rather than a republic, Lawrence called for an absolute Dictator and equivalent Dictatrix to lord over the lower peoples.[19] Lawrence continued throughout his life to develop his highly personal philosophy. His unpublished introduction to Sons and Lovers established the duality central to much of his fiction. This is done with reference to the Holy Trinity. As his philosophy develops, Lawrence moves away from more direct Christian analogies and instead touches upon Mysticism, Buddhism, and Pagan theologies.[citation needed] Lawrence\'s opinion of the masses is detailed by Professor John Carey in The Intellectuals and the Masses (1992). He quotes a 1908 letter from Lawrence to Blanche Jennings: Lawrence is perhaps best known for his novels Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow, Women in Love and Lady Chatterley\'s Lover. Within these Lawrence explores the possibilities for life and living within an industrial setting. In particular Lawrence is concerned with the nature of relationships that can be had within such settings. Though often classed as a realist, Lawrence\'s use of his characters can be better understood with reference to his philosophy. His depiction of sexual activity, though shocking at the time, has its roots in this highly personal way of thinking and being. It is worth noting that Lawrence was very interested in human touch behaviour (see Haptics) and that his interest in physical intimacy has its roots in a desire to restore our emphasis on the body, and re-balance it with what he perceived to be western civilisation\'s slow process of over-emphasis on the mind. In his later years Lawrence developed the potentialities of the short novel form in St Mawr, The Virgin and the Gypsy and The Escaped Cock. Lawrence\'s best-known short stories include The Captain\'s Doll, The Fox, The Ladybird, Odour of Chrysanthemums, The Princess, The Rocking-Horse Winner, St Mawr, The Virgin and the Gypsy and The Woman who Rode Away. (The Virgin and the Gypsy was published as a novella after he died.) Among his most praised collections is The Prussian Officer and Other Stories, published in 1914. His collection The Woman Who Rode Away and Other Stories, published in 1928, develops his themes of leadership that he also explored in novels such as Kangaroo, The Plumed Serpent and Fanny and Annie. Although best known for his novels, Lawrence wrote almost 800 poems, most of them relatively short. His first poems were written in 1904 and two of his poems, Dreams Old and Dreams Nascent, were among his earliest published works in The English Review. His early works clearly place him in the school of Georgian poets, a group not only named after the reigning monarch but also to the romantic poets of the previous Georgian period whose work they were trying to emulate. What typified the entire movement, and Lawrence\'s poems of the time, were well-worn poetic tropes and deliberately archaic language. Many of these poems displayed what John Ruskin referred to as the pathetic fallacy, the tendency to ascribe human emotions to animals and even inanimate objects. Just as the First World War dramatically changed the work of many of the poets who saw service in the trenches, Lawrence\'s own work saw a dramatic change, during his years in Cornwall. During this time, he wrote free verse influenced by Walt Whitman. He set forth his manifesto for much of his later verse in the introduction to New Poems. "We can get rid of the stereotyped movements and the old hackneyed associations of sound or sense. We can break down those artificial conduits and canals through which we do so love to force our utterance. We can break the stiff neck of habit...But we cannot positively prescribe any motion, any rhythm." Lawrence rewrote many of his novels several times to perfect them and similarly he returned to some of his early poems when they were collected in 1928. This was in part to fictionalise them, but also to remove some of the artifice of his first works. As he put in himself: "A young man is afraid of his demon and puts his hand over the demon\'s mouth sometimes and speaks for him." His best known poems are probably those dealing with nature such as those in Birds Beasts and Flowers and Tortoises. Snake, one of his most frequently anthologised, displays some of his most frequent concerns; those of man\'s modern distance from nature and subtle hints at religious themes. In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree\nI came down the steps with my pitcher\nAnd must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough before me.\n(Excerpt, "Snake") Look! We have come through! is his other work from the period of the end of the war and it reveals another important element common to much of his writings; his inclination to lay himself bare in his writings. Although Lawrence could be regarded as a writer of love poems, his usually deal in the less romantic aspects of love such as sexual frustration or the sex act itself. Ezra Pound in his Literary Essays complained of Lawrence\'s interest in his own "disagreeable sensations" but praised him for his "low-life narrative." This is a reference to Lawrence\'s dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of Robert Burns, in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of Nottinghamshire from his youth. Tha thought tha wanted ter be rid o\' me.\n\'Appen tha did, an\' a\'.\nTha thought tha wanted ter marry an\' se\nIf ter couldna be master an\' th\' woman\'s boss,\nTha\'d need a woman different from me,\nAn\' tha knowed it; ay, yet tha comes across\nTer say goodbye! an\' a\'.\n(Excerpt, "The Drained Cup") Although Lawrence\'s works after his Georgian period are clearly in the modernist tradition, they were often very different from those of many other modernist writers, such as Pound. His modernist works were often austere, where every word was carefully worked on. Lawrence felt all poems had to be personal sentiments and that a sense of spontaneity was vital for any work. He called one collection of poems Pansies, partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse but also as a pun on the French word panser, to dress or bandage a wound. "Pansies", as Lawrence himself made explicit in the introduction to New Poems, is also a pun on Blaise Pascal\'s Penses. "The Noble Englishman" and "Don\'t Look at Me" were removed from the official edition of Pansies on the grounds of obscenity, which wounded him. Even though he lived most of the last ten years of his life abroad, his thoughts were often still on England. Published in 1930, just eleven days after his death, his last work Nettles was a series of bitter, nettling but often wry attacks on the moral climate of England. O the stale old dogs who pretend to guard\nthe morals of the masses,\nhow smelly they make the great back-yard\nwetting after everyone that passes.\n(Excerpt, "The Young and Their Moral Guardians") Two notebooks of Lawrence\'s unprinted verse were posthumously published as Last Poems and More Pansies. These contain two of Lawrence\'s most famous poems about death, Bavarian Gentians and The Ship of Death. Lawrence\'s criticism of other authors often provides great insight into his own thinking and writing. Of particular note is his Study of Thomas Hardy and Other Essays and Studies in Classic American Literature. In the latter, Lawrence\'s responses to Whitman, Melville and Edgar Allan Poe shed particular light on the nature of Lawrence\'s craft. A heavily censored abridgement of Lady Chatterley\'s Lover was published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in 1928. This edition was posthumously re-issued in paperback in America both by Signet Books and by Penguin Books in 1946[citation needed]. When the full unexpurgated edition of Lady Chatterley\'s Lover was published by Penguin Books in Britain in 1960, the trial of Penguin under the Obscene Publications Act of 1959 became a major public event and a test of the new obscenity law. The 1959 act (introduced by Roy Jenkins) had made it possible for publishers to escape conviction if they could show that a work was of literary merit. One of the objections was to the frequent use of the word "fuck" and its derivatives and the word "cunt". Various academic critics and experts of diverse kinds, including E. M. Forster, Helen Gardner, Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams and Norman St John-Stevas, were called as witnesses, and the verdict, delivered on 2 November 1960, was "not guilty". This resulted in a far greater degree of freedom for publishing explicit material in the UK. The prosecution was ridiculed for being out of touch with changing social norms when the chief prosecutor, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, asked if it were the kind of book "you would wish your wife or servants to read". The Penguin second edition, published in 1961, contains a publisher\'s dedication, which reads: "For having published this book, Penguin Books were prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a verdict of \'Not Guilty\' and thus made D. H. Lawrence\'s last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom." The obituaries shortly after Lawrence\'s death were, with the notable exception of E. M. Forster, unsympathetic or hostile. However, there were those who articulated a more favourable recognition of the significance of this author\'s life and works. For example, his longtime friend Catherine Carswell summed up his life in a letter to the periodical Time and Tide published on 16 March 1930. In response to his critics, she claimed: Aldous Huxley also defended Lawrence in his introduction to a collection of letters published in 1932. However, the most influential advocate of Lawrence\'s contribution to literature was the Cambridge literary critic F. R. Leavis who asserted that the author had made an important contribution to the tradition of English fiction. Leavis stressed that The Rainbow, Women in Love, and the short stories and tales were major works of art. Later, the Lady Chatterley Trial of 1960, and subsequent publication of the book, ensured Lawrence\'s popularity (and notoriety) with a wider public. Lawrence held seemingly contradictory views of feminism. The evidence of his written works indicates an overwhelming commitment to representing women as strong, independent and complex; he produced major works in which young, self-directing female characters were central. However, Harrison[20] drew attention to the vein of sadism that runs through Lawrence\'s writing, and a number of feminist critics, notably Kate Millett, have criticised, indeed ridiculed Lawrence\'s sexual politics, Millett claiming that he uses his female characters as mouthpieces to promote his creed of male supremacy.[21] This damaged his reputation in some quarters, although Norman Mailer came to Lawrence\'s defence in The Prisoner of Sex in 1971.[22] Yet Lawrence continues to find an audience, and the ongoing publication of a new scholarly edition of his letters and writings has demonstrated the range of his achievement. D. H. Lawrence had a lifelong interest in painting, which became one of his main forms of expression in his last years. These were exhibited at the Warren Gallery in London\'s Mayfair in 1929. The exhibition was extremely controversial, with many of the 13,000people visiting mainly to gawk. The Daily Express claimed "Fight with an Amazon represents a hideous, bearded man holding a fair-haired woman in his lascivious grip while wolves with dripping jaws look on expectantly, [this] is frankly indecent", but several artists and art experts praised the paintings. Gwen John, reviewing the exhibition in Everyman, spoke of Lawrence\'s "stupendous gift of self-expression" and singled out The Finding of Moses, Red Willow Trees and Boccaccio Story as "pictures of real beauty and great vitality". Others singled out Contadini for special praise. After a complaint from a member of the public, the police seized thirteen of the twenty-five paintings on view (including Boccaccio Story and Contadini). Despite declarations of support from many writers, artists and members of parliament, Lawrence was able to recover his paintings only by undertaking never to exhibit them in England again. The largest collection of the paintings is now at La Fonda de Taos[23] hotel in Taos, New Mexico.

aS'Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (/solnitsn/;[1] Russian:   , pronounced[lksandr savt slnitsn]; 11December 1918 3August 2008)[2] was a Russian novelist, historian, and tireless critic of Communist totalitarianism. He helped to raise global awareness of the gulag and the Soviet Union\'s forced labor camp system. While his writings were often suppressed, he wrote several books most notably The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, two of his best-known works. "For the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature",[3] Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970. He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 but returned to Russia in 1994 after the Soviet system had collapsed. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk, RSFSR (now in Stavropol Krai, Russia). His mother, Taisiya Solzhenitsyna (ne Shcherbak) was Ukrainian.[4][5] Her father had apparently[citation needed] risen from humble beginnings, as something of a self-made man. Eventually, he acquired a large estate in the Kuban region in the northern foothills of the Caucasus. During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the Imperial Russian Army of Cossack origins and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of August 1914, and in the later Red Wheel novels. In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Alexandr. Shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident. Alexandr was then raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances. His earliest years coincided with the Russian Civil War. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a collective farm. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father\'s background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the Russian Orthodox faith;[6] she died in 1944.[7] As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn was developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on World War I and the Russian Revolution. This eventually led to the novel August 1914  some of the chapters he wrote then still survive.[citation needed] Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at Rostov State University. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope. As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps.[citation needed] During the war Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound-ranging battery in the Red Army,[8] was involved in major action at the front, and twice decorated. A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel Love the Revolution!, chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.[9] In February 1945, while serving in East Prussia, Solzhenitsyn was arrested for writing derogatory comments in private letters to a friend, Nikolai Vitkevich,[10] about the conduct of the war by Joseph Stalin, whom he called "Khozyain" ("the boss"), and "Balabos", (Yiddish rendering of Hebrew baal ha-bayi for "master of the house").[11] He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under Article 58 paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of "founding a hostile organization" under paragraph 11.[12] Solzhenitsyn was taken to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, where he was interrogated. On 7 July 1945, he was sentenced in his absence by Special Council of the NKVD to an eight-year term in a labor camp. This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the time.[13] The first part of Solzhenitsyn\'s sentence was served in several different work camps; the "middle phase," as he later referred to it, was spent in a sharashka (i.e., a special scientific research facility run by Ministry of State Security), where he met Lev Kopelev, upon whom he based the character of Lev Rubin in his book The First Circle, published in a self-censored or "distorted" version in the West in 1968 (an English translation of the full version was eventually published by Harper Perennial in October 2009).[14] In 1950, he was sent to a "Special Camp" for political prisoners. During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of Ekibastuz in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer, and foundry foreman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. One of his fellow political prisoners, Ion Moraru, remembers that Solzhenitsyn spent some of his time at Ekibastuz writing.[15] While there he had a tumor removed, although his cancer was not diagnosed at the time. In March 1953 after the expiry of Solzhenitsyn\'s sentence, he was sent to internal exile for life at Kok-Terek in the northeastern region of Kazakhstan, very close to the current border with Russia, as was common for political prisoners. His undiagnosed cancer spread until, by the end of the year, he was close to death. However, in 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in Tashkent, where his tumor went into remission. His experiences there became the basis of his novel Cancer Ward and also found an echo in the short story "The Right Hand." It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned Marxism and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life; this turn has some interesting parallels to Fyodor Dostoyevsky\'s time in Siberia and his quest for faith a hundred years earlier. Solzhenitsyn gradually turned into a philosophically minded Christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps.[16][17] He repented for some of his actions as a Red Army captain, and in prison compared himself to the perpetrators of the Gulag: "I remember myself in my captain\'s shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: \'So were we any better?\'" His transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of The Gulag Archipelago ("The Soul and Barbed Wire"). The narrative poem The Trail (written without benefit of pen or paper in prison and camps between 1947 and 1952) and the 28 poems composed in prison, forced-labor camp, and exile also provide crucial material for understanding Solzhenitsyn\'s intellectual and spiritual odyssey during this period. These "early" works, largely unknown in the West, were published for the first time in Russian in 1999 and excerpted in English in 2006.[18][19] On 7 April 1940, while at the university, Solzhenitsyn married Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaya.[20] They had just over a year of married life before he went into the army, and then to the Gulag. They divorced in 1952, a year before his release, because wives of Gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits. After the end of his internal exile, they remarried in 1957.[21] They divorced in 1972. The following year (1973) he married his second wife, Natalia Dmitrievna Svetlova, a mathematician who had a son from a brief prior marriage.[22] He and Svetlova (born 1939) had three sons: Yermolai (1970), Ignat (1972), and Stepan (1973).[23] After Khrushchev\'s Secret Speech in 1956 Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and exonerated. After his return to European Russia, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote that "during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known."[24] In 1960, aged 42, he approached Aleksandr Tvardovsky, a poet and the chief editor of the Novyi Mir magazine, with the manuscript of One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit approval of Nikita Khrushchev, who defended it at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publishing, and added: "There\'s a Stalinist in each of you; there\'s even a Stalinist in me. We must root out this evil."[25] The book quickly sold-out and became an instant hit.[citation needed] In the 1960s, while he was publicly known to be writing Cancer Ward, he was simultaneously writing The Gulag Archipelago. During Khrushchev\'s tenure, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich was studied in schools in the Soviet Union as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn\'s, including his acclaimed short story Matryona\'s Home, published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990. One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich brought the Soviet system of prison labor to the attention of the West. It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the Westnot only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for "libelous speech" about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn\'s story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end. Every time when we speak about Solzhenitsyn as the enemy of the Soviet regime, this just happens to coincide with some important [international] events and we postpone the decision. Solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel, Cancer Ward, legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the approval of the Union of Writers. Though some there appreciated it, the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations (this episode is recounted and documented in The Oak and the Calf). After Krushchev\'s removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. The publishing of Solzhenitsyn\'s work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a non-person, and, by 1965, the KGB had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of The First Circle. Meanwhile Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most subversive of all his writings, The Gulag Archipelago. The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an "officially acclaimed" writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant. After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn\'s materials in Moscow, during 19651967 the preparatory drafts of The Gulag Archipelago were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends\' homes in Estonia. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended Arnold Susi, a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a Lubyanka Prison cell. After completion, Solzhenitsyn\'s original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi\'s daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union.[26][27] In 1969 Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He could not receive the prize personally in Stockholm at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow. The Swedish government refused to accept this solution, however, since such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Sweden\'s relations with the superpower. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been deported from the Soviet Union. The Gulag Archipelago was composed during 19581967. This work was a three-volume, seven part work on the Soviet prison camp system (Solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at any one time). The Gulag Archipelago has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages. It was based upon Solzhenitsyn\'s own experience as well as the testimony of 256[28] former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn\'s own research into the history of the penal system. It discussed the system\'s origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with Vladimir Lenin having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, prisoner uprisings and revolts, and the practice of internal exile. According to fellow gulag historian Anne Applebaum, The Gulag Archipelago\'s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made The Gulag Archipelago one of the most consequential books of the 20th century.[29] The The Gulag Archipelago was met with extensive criticism by Soviet press, even though the book was not published in the USSR. An editorial in Pravda on 14 January 1974 accused Solzhenitsyn of supporting "Hitlerites" and making "excuses for the crimes of the Vlasovites and Bandera gangs". According to the editorial, Solzhenitsyn was "choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up, for the socialist system, and for Soviet people."[30] During this period, he was sheltered by the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.[citation needed] In August 1971 the KGB allegedly made an attempt to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent (most likely ricin) with an experimental gel-based delivery method. The attempt left him seriously ill but ultimately was not successful.[31][32] On 12 February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the USSR to Frankfurt, West Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship.[33] The KGB had found the manuscript for the first part of The Gulag Archipelago and, less than a week later, Yevgeny Yevtushenko suffered reprisals for his support of Solzhenitsyn. U.S. military attach William Odom managed to smuggle out a large portion of Solzhenitsyn\'s archive, including the author\'s membership card for the Writers\' Union and Second World War military citations; Solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to Odom\'s role in his memoir "Invisible Allies" (1995).[34] In Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in Heinrich Bll\'s house in Cologne. He then moved to Zurich, Switzerland before Stanford University invited him to stay in the United States to "facilitate your work, and to accommodate you and your family." He stayed on the 11th floor of the Hoover Tower, part of the Hoover Institution, before moving to Cavendish, Vermont in 1976. He was given an honorary Literary Degree from Harvard University in 1978 and on Thursday, 8 June 1978 he gave his Commencement Address [35] condemning, among other things, rationalistic humanism in modern western culture. Over the next 17 years, Solzhenitsyn worked on his cyclical history of the Russian Revolution of 1917, The Red Wheel. By 1992, four "knots" (parts) had been completed and he had also written several shorter works. Despite spending almost two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother[citation needed]. More importantly, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn\'s warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in Western conservative circles (e.g. Ford administration staffers Richard Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld advocated on Solzhenitsyn\'s behalf for him to speak directly to then-President Gerald Ford about the Soviet threat),[36] prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by U.S. President Ronald Reagan. At the same time, liberals and secularists became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his reactionary preference for Russian nationalism and the Russian Orthodox religion. Solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant pop culture of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: "...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today\'s mass living habits... by TV stupor and by intolerable music". Despite his criticism of the "weakness" of the West, Solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies. In a major speech delivered to the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993, Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to "lose sight of its own values, its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of lawa hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen."[37] In a series of writings, speeches, and interviews after his return to his native Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self-government he had witnessed first hand in Switzerland and New England during his western exile.[38][39] He "praised \'the sensible and sure process of grassroots democracy, in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own, not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities.\'"[40] In 1990, his Soviet citizenship was restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his oldest son Yermolai returned to Russia to work for the Moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a dacha in Troitse-Lykovo (-) in west Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders Mikhail Suslov and Konstantin Chernenko. A staunch believer in traditional Russian culture, Solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post-Soviet Russia and called for a restoration of the Russian monarchy.[41] After returning to Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative "miniatures" or prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West (The Grain Between the Millstones) among many other writings. All of Solzhenitsyn\'s sons became U.S. citizens.[42] One, Ignat, has achieved acclaim as a pianist and conductor in the United States.[43] Solzhenitsyn died of heart failure near Moscow on 3 August 2008, at the age of 89.[33][44] A burial service was held at Donskoy Monastery, Moscow, on Wednesday, 6 August 2008.[45] He was buried on the same date at the place chosen by him in Donskoy necropolis.[46] Russian and world leaders paid tribute to Solzhenitsyn following his death.[47] The most complete 30-volume edition of Solzhenitsyn\'s collected works is soon to be published in Russia. The presentation of its first three volumes, already in print, recently took place in Moscow. Unhappy with the economic and social malaise of the Yeltsin era, Solzhenitsyn expressed his admiration for President Vladimir Putin\'s attempts to restore a sense of national pride in Russia. Putin signed a decree conferring on Solzhenitsyn the State Prize of the Russian Federation for his humanitarian work and personally visited the writer at his home on 12 June 2007 to present him with the award. Like his father, Yermolai Solzhenitsyn has translated some of his father\'s works. Stephan Solzhenitsyn lives and works in Moscow. Ignat Solzhenitsyn is the music director of The Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. Solzhenitsyn continues to be met with controversy in Russia. In February 2010, young left-wing activists in Moscow organized protests against measures by the government in renaming the Great Communist Street in Moscow in honor of Solzhenitsyn. The protesters cited the activities and literature of Solzhenitsyn for their position.[48] On 19 September 1974, Yuri Andropov approved a large-scale operation to discredit Solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his communications with Soviet dissidents. The plan was jointly approved by Vladimir Kryuchkov, Philipp Bobkov, and Grigorenko (heads of First, Second and Fifth KGB Directorates).[49] The residencies in Geneva, London, Paris, Rome and other European cities participated in the operation. Among other active measures, at least three StB agents became translators and secretaries of Solzhenitsyn (one of them translated the poem Prussian Nights), keeping KGB informed regarding all contacts by Solzhenitsyn.[49] The KGB sponsored a series of hostile books about Solzhenitsyn, most notably a "memoir published under the name of his first wife, Natalia Reshetovskaya, but probably mostly composed by Service", according to historian Christopher Andrew.[49] Andropov also gave an order to create "an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between PAUK[50] and the people around him" by feeding him rumors that everyone in his surrounding was a KGB agent and deceiving him in all possible ways. Among other things, the writer constantly received envelopes with photographs of car accidents, brain surgery and other frightening illustrations. After the KGB harassment in Zurich, Solzhenitsyn settled in Cavendish, Vermont, reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a barbed wire fence. His influence and moral authority for the West diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of Western individualism. KGB and CPSU experts finally concluded that he alienated American listeners by his "reactionary views and intransigent criticism of the US way of life", so no further active measures would be required.[49] In his book The Gulag Archipelago Solzhenitsyn states that he was recruited to report to the NKVD on fellow inmates and was given a code-name Vetrov, but due to his transfer to another camp he was able to elude this duty and never produced a single report.[51] In 1976, after Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Soviet Union a report signed by Vetrov surfaced. After a copy of the report was obtained by Solzhenitsyn he published it together with a refutation in the Los Angeles Times (published 24 May 1976).[51] In 1978 the same report was published by journalist Frank Arnau in a socialist Western German magazine Neue Politik.[52] However, according to Solzhenitsyn the report is a fabrication by the KGB. He claimed that the report is dated 20 January 1952 while all Ukrainians were transferred to a separate camp on 6 January and they had no relation to the uprising in Solzhenitsyn\'s camp on 22 January. He also claimed that the only people who might in 1976 have access to a "secret KGB archive" were KGB agents themselves. Solzhenitsyn also requested Arnau to put the alleged document to a graphology test but Arnau refused.[51] In 1990 the report was reproduced in Soviet Voyenno-Istoricheskiy Zhurnal among the memoirs of L.A. Samutin,[53] a former ROA soldier and GULAG inmate who was an erstwhile supporter of Solzhenitsyn, but later became his critic. According to Solzhenitsyn, publication of the Samutin memoirs was canceled at the request of Samutin\'s widow, who stated that the memoirs were in fact dictated by the KGB.[51] Regarding atheism, Solzhenitsyn declared: Over a half century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of old people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: "Men have forgotten God; that\'s why all this has happened." Since then I have spent well-nigh 50 years working on the history of our revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: "Men have forgotten God; that\'s why all this has happened."[54] If I would care to generalise, and to say that the life of the Jews in the camps was especially hard, I could, and would not face reproach for an unjust national generalisation. But in the camps where I was kept, it was different. The Jews whose experience I saw  their life was softer than that of others. Solzhenitsyn also published a two-volume work on the history of Russian-Jewish relations (Two Hundred Years Together 2001, 2002). This book stirred controversy and caused Solzhenitsyn to be accused of anti-Semitism.[56][57][58][59] The book became a best-seller in Russia. Solzhenitsyn begins this work with a plea for "patient mutual comprehension" on the part of Russians and Russian Jews. The author writes that the book was conceived in the hope of promoting "mutually agreeable and fruitful pathways for the future development of Russian-Jewish relations".[60] There is sharp division on the allegation of anti-Semitism. From Solzhenitsyn\'s own essay "Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations",[61] he calls for Russians and Jews alike to take moral responsibility for the "renegades" from both communities who enthusiastically supported a Marxist dictatorship after the October Revolution. At the end of chapter 15, he writes that Jews must answer for the "revolutionary cutthroats" in their ranks just as Russian Gentiles must repent "for the pogroms, for those merciless arsonist peasants, for...crazed revolutionary soldiers." It is not, he adds, a matter of answering "before other peoples, but to oneself, to one\'s consciousness, and before God."[62] Writing of Solzhenitsyn\'s novel, August 1914 in the New York Times on 13 November 1985, the American historian Richard Pipes commented: "Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism. In Solzhenitsyn\'s case, it\'s not racial. It has nothing to do with blood. He\'s certainly not a racist; the question is fundamentally religious and cultural. He bears some resemblance to Dostoyevsky, who was a fervent Christian and patriot and a rabid anti-Semite. Solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the Russian extreme right\'s view of the Revolution, which is that it was the doing of the Jews".[63] According to D. M. Thomas, Elie Wiesel said Solzhenitsyn is not an anti-Semite. "he is too intelligent, too honest, too courageous, too great a writer." He says he wishes Solzhenitsyn were more sensitive to Jewish suffering, but believes the insensitivity is unconscious. This statement however predates the publication in 2001 of "Two Hundred Years Together" by at least 3 years.[64] Similarities between Two Hundred Years Together and an anti-Semitic essay titled "Jews in the USSR and in the Future Russia", attributed to Solzhenitsyn, has led to inference that he stands behind the anti-Semitic passages. Solzhenitsyn himself claims that the essay consists of manuscripts stolen from him, and then manipulated, forty years ago.[65][66] However, according to the historian Semyon Reznik, textological analyses have proven Solzhenitsyn\'s authorship.[67] In 1984 Solzhenitsyn was interviewed by Nikolay Kazantsev, a monarchist Russo-Argentine journalist, for Nasha Strana, a Russia-language newspaper based in Buenos Aires. In the interview he said: "We (Russia) are walking a narrow isthmus between Communists and the World Jewry. Neither is acceptable for us... And I mean this not in the racial sense, but in the sense of the Jewry as a certain world view. The Jewry is embodied in "Fevralism" (i.e. democracy). Neither side is acceptable to us in the case the War breaks out." He also described the United States as a "province of Israel".[68] In some of his later political writings, such as Rebuilding Russia (1990) and Russia in Collapse (1998), Solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new Russian \'democracy,\' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet Communism. He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to radical nationalism), argued for the indispensability of local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the "near abroad" of the former Soviet Union. He sought to protect the national character of the Russian Orthodox church and fought against the admission of Catholic priests and Protestant pastors to Russia from other countries. For a brief period, he had his own TV show, where he freely expressed his views. The show was cancelled because of low ratings, but Solzhenitsyn continued to maintain a relatively high profile in the media.[citation needed] Delivering the commencement address at Harvard University in 1978, he called the United States spiritually weak and mired in vulgar materialism. Americans, he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, suffered from a "decline in courage" and a "lack of manliness." Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He condemned both the United States government and American society for its "hasty" capitulation in the Vietnam War. He criticized the country\'s music as intolerable and attacked its unfettered press, accusing it of violations of privacy. He said that the West erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model. While faulting Soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people, he also faulted the West for being too legalistic: "A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities."[35] In his 1978 Harvard address, Solzhenitsyn argued over Russian culture, that the West erred in "denying its autonomous character and therefore never understood it "[35] Solzhenitsyn emphasized the significantly more oppressive character of the Soviet totalitarian regime, in comparison to the Russian Empire of the House of Romanov. He asserted that Imperial Russia did not practice any real censorship in the style of the Soviet Glavlit,[69] that political prisoners typically were not always forced into labor camps,[70] and that the number of political prisoners and exiles was only one ten-thousandth of those in the Soviet Union. He noted that the Tsar\'s secret police, or Okhrana, was only present in the three largest cities, and not at all in the Imperial Russian Army.[citation needed] In a speech commemorating the Vende Uprising, Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin\'s Bolsheviks with Jacobins of the French Revolution. However, he commented that, while the French Reign of Terror ended with the execution of Maximilien Robespierre, its Soviet equivalent raged unabated from 1917 until the Khrushchev thaw in the 1950s.[citation needed] According to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all ethnic cultures have been oppressed in favor of an atheistic Marxism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, Russian nationalism and the Orthodox Church should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.[71] In "Rebuilding Russia," an essay first published in 1990 in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" Solzhenitsyn urged Russia to cast off all non-Slav republics, which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Kazakhstan that he considered to be Russified.[4] In 2006 Solzhenitsyn accused NATO of trying to bring Russia under its control; he claimed this was visual because of its "ideological support for the \'colour revolutions\' and the paradoxical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia".[72] In an 2006 interview with Der Spiegel he stated "This was especially painful in the case of Ukraine, a country whose closeness to Russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples, relatives living on different sides of the national border. At one fell stroke, these families could be torn apart by a new dividing line, the border of a military bloc."[73] Solzhenitsyn said that for every country, great power status deforms and harms the national character and that he has never wished great power status for Russia. He rejected the view that the USA and Russia are natural rivals, saying that before the [Russian] revolution, they were natural allies and that during the American Civil War, Russia supported Lincoln and the North [in contrast to Britain and France, which supported the Confederacy], and then they were allies in the First World War. But beginning with Communism, Russia ceased to exist and the confrontation was not at all with Russia but with the Communist Soviet Union. Solzhenitsyn criticized the Allies for not opening a new front against Nazi Germany in the west earlier in World War II. This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of Eastern Europe. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West. While stationed in East Prussia as an artillery officer, Solzhenitsyn witnessed war crimes against the civilian German population by Soviet "liberators" as the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and women were gang-raped to death. He wrote a poem entitled "Prussian Nights" about these incidents. In it, the first-person narrator seems to approve of the troops\' crimes as revenge for German atrocities, expressing his desire to take part in the plunder himself. The poem describes the rape of a Polish woman whom the Red Army soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German.[74] In 1973, near the height of the Sino-Soviet conflict, Solzhenitsyn sent a Letter to the Soviet Leaders to a limited number of upper echelon Soviet officials. This work, which was published for the general public in the Western world a year after it was sent to its intended audience, beseeched the Soviet Union\'s authorities to Give them their ideology! Let the Chinese leaders glory in it for a while. And for that matter, let them shoulder the whole sackful of unfulfillable international obligations, let them grunt and heave and instruct humanity, and foot all the bills for their absurd economics (a million a day just to Cuba), and let them support terrorists and guerrillas in the Southern Hemisphere too if they like. The main source of the savage feuding between us will then melt away, a great many points of today\'s contention and conflict all over the world will also melt away, and a military clash will become a much remoter possibility and perhaps won\'t take place at all [author\'s emphasis].[75] Once in America, Solzhenitsyn urged the United States to reconsider its attitudes to the Vietnam War (which had ended in April 1975). In his commencement address at Harvard University in 1978,[35] Solzhenitsyn alleged that many in the U.S. did not understand the Vietnam War. He rhetorically asks if the American Anti-War Movement ever realized the effects their actions had on Vietnam: "But members of the U.S. antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there?"[35] During his time in the United States, Solzhenitsyn made several controversial public statements: notably, he accused Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg of treason. Solzhenitsyn opined in Izvestia that 1930s famine on the Ukraine was no different from the Russian famine of 1921 as both were caused by the ruthless robbery of peasants by Bolshevik grain procurements. According to him, the lie of the Holodomor being genocide was invented decades later after the event, and Ukrainian effort to have the famine recognized as genocide is an act of historical revisionism that has now surpassed the level of Bolshevik agitprop. The writer cautioned that the genocidal claim has its chances to be accepted by the West due to the general western ignorance of Russian and Ukrainian history.[76] In "200 Years Together", Chapter 20: In the Camps of Gulag, Solzhenitsyn describes his play \'Republic of Labour\' describing the events that happened in the camp Bolshaya Kaluzhskaya 30. Solzhenitsyn goes on to describe the hostile antipathy the play aroused from his Jewish friends. In 1998, Russian filmmaker Alexander Sokurov shot TV documentary Besedy s Solzhenitsynym (The Dialogues with Solzhenitsyn) of four parts. The documentary shot in Solzhenitsyns home shows his everyday life and covers his reflections on Russian history and literature.[84][85] On 12 December 2009, the Russian channel Rossiya K showed the French television documentary L\'Histoire Secrte de l\'Archipel du Goulag[86] made by Jean Crpu and Nicolas Miletitch[87] and translated into Russian under the title Taynaya Istoriya Arkhipelaga GULAG (Secret History: The Gulag Archipelago). The documentary covers events related to creation and publication of The Gulag Archipelago.[86][88] '

aS'Barge Haulers on the Volga or Burlaki (Russian: Burlaki na Volge,   ) is a 18701873 oil-on-canvas painting by the Russian realist painter and sculptor Ilya Repin. The work depicts 11 labouring men dragging a barge on the Volga River. The men seem to almost collapse forward in exhaustion under the burden of hauling a large boat upstream in heavy, hot weather.[1][2] The work is both a celebration of the men\'s dignity and fortitude, and a highly emotional condemnation of those who sanctioned such inhumane labour.[3] Although they are presented as stoical and accepting, the men are largely defeated; only one stands out: in the centre of both the row and canvas, a brightly coloured youth fights against his leather binds and takes on a heroic poise. Repin conceived the painting during his travels through Russia as a young man and depicts actual characters he encountered. It drew international praise for its realistic portrayal of the hardships of working men, and launched his career.[4] Soon after its completion, the painting was purchased by Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich and exhibited widely throughout Europe as a landmark of Russian realist painting. Barge Haulers on the Volga has been described as "perhaps the most famous painting of the Peredvizhniki movement [for]....its unflinching portrayal of backbreaking labour".[5] Repin graduated from the Academy in St Petersburg in 1863. The academy at the time was known for its deep conservatism and leaning towards academic art, a fact that bred a sense of revolt and desire for change in many of its students.[6] Barge Haulers is inspired by scenes witnessed by the artist while holidaying on the Volga in 1870. He made a number of preparatory studies, mostly in oil, while staying in Shiriaev Buerak, near Stavropol.[6][7] The sketches include landscapes, and views of the Volga and barge haulers. The characters depicted are based on actual people whom the artist came to know while preparing the work. He had had difficulty finding subjects to pose for him, even for a fee, because of a folklorish belief that a subject\'s soul would leave his possession once his image was put down on paper.[8] The subjects include a former soldier, a former priest, and a painter.[9] Although Repin depicted eleven men, women also performed the work and there were normally many more people in a barge-hauling gang; Repin selected these figures as representative of a broad swathe of the working classes of Russian society. That some had once held relatively high social positions dismayed the young artist, who had initially planned to produce a far more superficial work contrasting exuberant day-trippers (which he himself had been) with the careworn burlaks. Repin found a particular empathy with Kanin, the defrocked priest, who is portrayed as the lead hauler and looks outwards towards the viewer.[10] The artist wrote, Barge Haulers on the Volga shows a row of eleven male burlaks dragging a barge on the Volga River that must be pulled upstream against the current.[12] The men are dressed in rags and bound with leather harnesses. They are rendered as mostly stoical, although in obvious physical discomfort, with their bodies bowed in toil.[9] The scene is rendered in a white, silvery light which has been described as "almost Venetian".[10] In earlier studies, it was dominated by blue tones. The men appear to be unsupervised and form the focus of the picture, with the barge relegated to a minor role at the rear of the frame. Further in the distance is a tiny steam-powered boat,[13] perhaps a suggestion that the back-breaking labour of the barge haulers is no longer necessary in the industrial age.[14] Also worthy of note is the inverted Russian flag flying from the main mast of the barge suggesting adding to the sense that something is not quite right. Repin echoes the stop-go rhythm of the labour in the undulating line of the workers\' heads. In the preparatory studies, many of the figures were positioned differently; for example the second man was shown wearing a cap with his head bowed into his chest.[10] There is a general sense of mounting exhaustion and despair moving from left to right amongst the group; the last hauler seems oblivious to his surroundings and drifts from the line out towards the viewer. The exception is a fair-haired boy in the centre of the group. Set brightly against the uniform muted tones of his companions, his head is raised looking into the distance, while he pulls against his straps as if determined to free himself from his task. Repin grew up in Chuguev in the Ukraine and was aware of the poverty and hardship of most rural life at that time. He spent two years travelling during which time he observed both the dachas of the rich and the toil of the common peasant. As such it can be considered a genre painting,[1] but treated on the heroic scale of history painting, as was often the case in 19th-century works, especially after A Burial At Ornans by Gustave Courbet (1850). Barge Haulers drew direct comparisons from critics with Millet\'s works and Courbet\'s The Stone Breakers (also 1850), which showed labourers at the side of a road.[15][16] The painting is a relentlessly physical description of the men; Repin was attracted by their strength and superhuman effort. According to critic Vladimir Stassov, "They are like a group of forest Hercules with their dishevelled heads, their sun-tanned chests, and their motionlessly hanging, strong-veined hands. What glances from untamed eyes, what distended nostrils, what iron muscles!"[17] In his description of their heavy brows and the lined foreheads, Repin does not neglect their spiritual torment; although he does not concentrate too much on any single man\'s personal intimate emotions. Any sense of personal hardship is of secondary importance to the portrayal of effort and human dignity.[17] Repin considered Barge Haulers to be his first professional painting and it is the work that defined him as a master documentarian of social inequality.[18] When first exhibited, it received enthusiastic reviews for its unsentimental depiction of lower-class labourers, which stood in stark contrast to the romanticised, classical or propagandist nature of most contemporary Russian art.[9] The painting paved the way for Repin to join the Peredvizhniki (the Wanderers or Itinerants), an anti-academic realist movement formed in 1870.[19] The Peredvizhniki sought not only to break away from the academic school, but also to subvert the manner in which art was viewed. By depicting scenes from ordinary life and holding exhibitions in the provinces they aimed to enlighten and make art more accessible to the masses.[18] The painting was widely discussed for its break with the traditions of the Academy. It earned Repin the respect of Stasov[6] who believed that art shaped people\'s outlook and the way in which they viewed their own political situation. Stasov encouraged Repin to focus on Russian subject matter and after Barge Haulers became a close friend of the artist and enthusiastically praised each of Repin\'s paintings thereafter. Stasov wrote of the painting, "with a daring that is unprecedented amongst us [Repin] has abandoned all former conceptions of the ideal in art, and has plunged head first into the very heart of the people\'s life, the people\'s interests, and the people\'s oppressive reality... no one in Russia has ever dared take on such a subject".[20] In return, Repin said that Stasov\'s "cry all over Russia was the first and the mightiest and it was heard in Russia by everyone capable of hearing. It was thanks to him that my glory spread."[21] Fyodor Dostoyevsky read about Repin\'s painting in the newspapers and assumed it was another Russian work whose artistry was secondary to its social message. He wrote, "Even the subject itself is terrible... I came expecting to see these barge-haulers all lined up in uniforms with the usual labels stuck to their foreheads... To my delight, all my fears turned out to be in vain... Not a single one of them shouts from the painting to the viewer, \'Look how unfortunate I am and how indebted you are to the people!\'"[22] To Dostoyevsky, Repin had avoided a common fault of contemporary Russian art, and in doing so had heightened the work\'s impact. He concluded, "[I saw] barge haulers, real barge haulers, and nothing more... you can\'t help but think you are indebted, truly indebted, to the people."[1] Such a feeling of an "unpaid debt" owed by the higher society to the peasantry was a common idea of the Narodniks.[23] Today the painting is regarded as seminal in the formation of Russian realism.[15] The painting has been criticised both for still bearing hallmarks of academic drawing and for having an overall yellowish tone.[17] Although it won a prize at the Society for the Advancement of the Arts in 1872, Repin continued to rework the canvas until 1873 when it was exhibited at the Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg.[7] Because of the work\'s popularity it has been widely parodied, and is often used as the basis for satirical political cartoons in Russia. It was inspired by the well-known Russian folk song "The Song of the Volga Boatmen".[citation needed] According to the art critic Elia Kabanov, Repin\'s painting influenced American orientalist painter Frederick Arthur Bridgman to produce his "Towing on the Nile" in 1875.[24] Despite its progressive implications, Barge Haulers was bought by the Tsar\'s second son. It was lent for exhibition at the 1873 International Exhibition in Vienna, where it won a bronze medal. It was exhibited outside Russia again in 1878, when it was again widely praised by critics for marking a watershed in Russian art.[15] After the Russian Revolution the grand duke\'s art collection was nationalized and transferred from Vladimir Palace to the Russian Museum.[25]'

aS'Charles Wachsmuth (September 13, 1829  February 7, 1896) was an American paleontologist born in Hanover. Educated as a lawyer, he left his profession due to ill-health and emigrated to the United States. He settled in Burlington, Iowa where he became fascinated with the crinoid fossils found in the local limestone formations. Within a few years he had built an extensive collection. In 1864 he met Louis Agassiz and the following year traveled to Europe where he studied crinoids in the British Museum and other famous collections. Inspired, he devoted all his energies to the continued collection and study of crinoid fossils. He supplied crinoid specimens to Agassiz in Cambridge and to the British Museum. He befriended another attorney, Frank Springer, in Burlington and together they continued the study of crinoids and published a series of important studies on the subject.

aS'The Cariboo Plateau is a volcanic plateau in south-central British Columbia, Canada. It is part of the Fraser Plateau that itself is a northward extension of the North American Plateau. The southern limit of the plateau is the Bonaparte River although some definitions include the Bonaparte Plateau between that river and the Thompson, but it properly is a subdivision of the Thompson Plateau. The portion of the Fraser Plateau west of the Fraser River is properly known as the Chilcotin Plateau but is often mistakenly considered to be part of the Cariboo Plateau, which is east of the Fraser. As a region and historical identity, the Cariboo is sometimes considered to extend to the Thompson River to the south of that, and to border on the city of Kamloops at its southeastern corner and even as far as Lytton, at the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers. The town of Lillooet is generally considered to be in the Cariboo, while the Bridge River Country to its west was sometimes referred to as the West Cariboo, as were also the ranches along the west side of the Fraser northwards towards the Gang Ranch. Broader meanings of "the Cariboo" sometimes include the Chilcotin, west of the Fraser. The geographic region known as the Quesnel Highland, which forms a mountainous series of foothills between the plateau proper and the Cariboo Mountains, is likewise considered to be part of the Cariboo in a cultural-historical sense not the least because it is the location of the famous Cariboo goldfields and the one-time economic capital of the Interior of British Columbia, Barkerville. The Cariboo is commonly divided into North Cariboo, Central Cariboo and South Cariboo. The commercial centre of the north is Quesnel, of the central Williams Lake and of the south 100 Mile House. The Cariboo region is generally considered to reach as far southeast as the city of Kamloops and to include the Cache Creek and Lillooet areas in the south. The region west of the Fraser River north of Lillooet, the Chilcotin, is often considered to be a part of the Cariboo; the country south of it immediately west of Lillooet is sometimes referred to as the West Cariboo. The Cariboo Plateau is made of Late Miocene flood basalt lavas of the Chilcotin Group, a group of related volcanic rocks that is nearly parallel with the Fraser Plateau.[1][2] It extends along the adjacent Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in the Coast Mountains. Volcanism of the Cariboo Plateau is considered to be a result of extension of the crust behind the coastal Cascadia subduction zone. Important events in the history of the Cariboo region: The Cariboo Trail is a 1950 film about the gold rush era of the 1890s in the area. The film is based on a story by John Rhodes Sturdy, screenplay by Frank Gruber, directed by Edwin L. Marin, and starring Randolph Scott and Gabby Hayes. Bowron Lake Provincial Park is a popular canoeing destination in the Cariboo Mountains east of Quesnel. Wells Gray Park to its south is partly in the Cariboo. '

aS'The Cat Who Went Underground is the ninth novel in the Cat Who series of murder mystery novels by Lilian Jackson Braun. This summary is taken from the back cover of the Recorded Books (ISBN 0-7887-5491-2) version of the book: "Despite his horoscope\'s dire predictions of doom, Qwill plans to spend a peaceful, trouble-free summer in his 75-year-old cabin in Mooseville. But peaceful and trouble-free it is not to be. Qwill\'s cabin soon turns into something out of a Three Stooges skit, and the handyman he hires to do some necessary renovations disappears without a word. Curious about the high mortality rate among Mooseville\'s carpenter class, Qwill starts to suspect foul play. Koko only adds to his misgivings by enigmatically thumping his tail in Qwill\'s face every five minutes -- in perfect synchronization, one might say -- with Qwill\'s own twitching mustache. By summer\'s end the cabin is beyond repair -- and Qwill is under suspicion of murder." With Polly Duncan in England, Qwilleran realizes that Pickax is a bore in summer. So he decides to go to his cabin on the lakeshore in Mooseville. Shortly before Qwill arrives, Buddy Yarrow, a carpenter, drowns while fishing, but the police report it as an accident. When he arrives, Qwill discovers his heater is broken, so calls a nearby resident and friend, Mildred Hanstable. She suggests subscribing to "Glinko," a family "network" that "dispatches" people like plumbers, electricians and others for emergencies. The plumber "dispatched" is Joanna Trump, known to many as Little Joe, who is the daughter of Big Joe, a carpenter who was recently killed in an accident. She makes many visits to fix broken plumbing equipment. Qwill is annoyed at the constant breakdowns and sometimes even suspects her of breaking things on purpose, but is never really sure. He decides to build an addition to his cabin, but is advised against it, because during the summer, all the good contractors are busy with big jobs, so the people are forced to hire itinerant carpenters, or Underground Builders as they are referred to by the locals, who are unreliable. But Qwilleran was lucky and found out that Clem Cottle, a reliable and experienced carpenter, needed money and so could work for Qwill. He builds steps to the beach and begins on Qwill\'s addition, but goes missing shortly after. Despite the assurances by Clem\'s father that he is on a last fling before he marries, Qwill, Clem\'s mother, and Clem\'s soon-to-be wife do not believe that. One day while biking on an abandoned road used only by hunters (and Clem was not a hunter), Qwill finds Clem\'s truck abandoned in a ditch. So he reports Clem\'s disappearance and begins to look for a replacement. When Clem went missing, Koko began tapping his tail three times, similar to the way Clem hammered nails. Eventually, Qwilleran resorts to an underground builder by the name of Iggy. He is lazy, has a nicotine addiction, and very large teeth. After doing a few days of work, in which little progress was made, he goes missing, only to reappear a few days later. That day Qwilleran and two friends go on a trip to Three Tree Island, a small island in the middle of the lake with a small shack, a dock, and three trees. John Bushland and Roger MacGillivray are looking for the scorched sand a helicopter pilot said he saw. They believe it was left by UFOs, or visitors as they are referred by the locals, but Qwill is skeptical of such things and does not expect to find anything. After a squall hits, the men become stranded on the island and are later rescued after a harrowing experience and taken to the Pickax hospital. He is released the next day and arrives home to find Iggy\'s truck is parked in the drive, but the carpenter is nowhere to be found. Koko then begins to paw excitedly at the trap door to the crawlspace under the cabin, which is where all the pipes and electrical wires enter the house, and Qwill lets Koko in. Koko had recently shown a great interest in the trap door, and to try to convince Koko there\'s no reason to go down, Qwilleran closes the door behind him, and goes to lunch. When he returns, Yum Yum shows she is worried about Koko and so he goes down to get Koko. But Qwilleran finds Koko digging, and helps him uncover Iggy\'s dead body. The discovery of this death begins to convince Qwilleran that something is happening to carpenters that is causing their demise. He reads some papers of Emma Wimsey, an old woman who was interviewed by Qwilleran for the Qwill Pen and was so delighted she gave him some of her old papers, and discovered that Little Joe was Emma\'s granddaughter and had had a troubled life. Her mother married Big Joe and lived a terrible life. She and her children were poor, didn\'t have proper clothes, and were abused by their father. This was so terrible that Joannas younger sister shot herself. Qwilleran rides out to her house to give her the papers, but finds it flooded by the rain that came with the storm that marooned Qwill on the island. But her truck is not there so he assumes she got away safely. But while he is there, he finds Clem Cottles jacket. Qwill learns that local riff raff believe he is responsible for Iggy\'s death. Also, a policeman overheard him discussing how frustrating it was to have an underground builder, and even his statement, "I could clobber him with a two-by-four..." The police mentioned this during a second questioning, but then the phone rang and the cats acted as though it scared them (though the telephone had never scared them before) and police left without getting an answer to that particular question. Nick Bamba, a friend of Qwilleran\'s who is an engineer at the state prison, says he heard about some nasty rumors about Qwilleran, and says he will stay with Qwill that night, with his camper blocking the entrance, a shotgun, a rifle, and the sheriff alerted. Early in the morning, Koko begins acting the way he did when he uncovered Iggy\'s body. Qwilleran lets the cat down and he leads them to a list of names of carpenters who had died recently, written in the lipstick used by Little Joe. Qwill calls Glinko and fakes an emergency so that Little Joe comes. He then confronts her with the murder of her father, which she rigged so it appeared to be an accident; Buddy Yarrow, who was fishing on her property; Murt, another underground builder who went missing and was never seen again; Clem Cottle; and Iggy, whose real name is Ignatius K. Small. She says simply that Louise did the killings and then ran off. Qwill calls the police and Little Joe is arrested.

aS'Flying Childers was a famous undefeated 18th century Thoroughbred racehorse, foaled in 1714 at Carr House, Warmsworth, Doncaster, and is often cited as the first truly great racehorse in the history of Thoroughbreds. Flying Childers was sired by the great Darley Arabian, one of the three foundation stallions of the Thoroughbred breed. His dam Betty Leedes, was by (Old) Careless and she was inbred to Spanker in the second and third generations (2x3). Betty Leedes was also the dam of the unraced, but successful sire, Bartlett\'s or Bleeding Childers who was also by the Darley Arabian. (Old) Careless was by the great stallion Spanker, and both were thought to be the best racehorses of their generation.[2] Betty Leedes was one of the few outside mares allowed to breed to the Darley Arabian, who was mostly kept as a private sire by his owner.[3] Flying Childers gained the name of his breeder, Colonel Leonard Childers, in addition to his owner, the Duke of Devonshire, often being referred to as either Devonshire Childers or Flying Childers or sometimes simpy Childers[4]. Although the Duke received many offers for the colt, including one to pay for the horse\'s weight in gold, he remained the animal\'s owner throughout his life. First racing at age six, the 15.2 hand colt won his maiden race, held April 1721 at Newmarket, to defeat Speedwell. He then won his second race in October, also at Newmarket, in a walk over, and his third race against Almanzor. It is said he completed this race, over the Round Course at Newmarket, in 6 minutes, 40 seconds and that he moved 82 1/2 feet per second or 1 mile per minute.[5] This was claimed to make Flying Childers the only horse on record as having matched the top speed of the unbeaten Eclipse.[6] By way of comparison, this would be nearly 40 seconds faster than the unbeaten Frankel ran the Newmarket Rowley Mile in his famous 2,000 Guineas victory of 2011, over 30 seconds faster than the current mile track record and very close to the five furlong track record set by Lochsong in 1994.[7] As a seven-year-old, he won his one start, a race at Newmarket where he beat Chaunter. In 1723, he won both his starts by walk over, one in April at Newmarket, the other a matchrace against Bobsey, who forfeited. Flying Childers then retired to stud. [4] Flying Childers stood as a private stallion at the Duke\'s Chatsworth estate in Derbyshire, until his death in 1741 at age 26. His offspring included several full-siblings from the Basto Mare: Blacklegs (br. 1728), a successful racehorse and sire for the Duke, Snip (b. 1736), a poor racehorse who sired the great stallion (Old) Snap, Second (br. 1732), who defeated both Sultan and Partner in 1737, Bay Basto (1729), Hip (1733), and Brown Basto (1738). He also sired Spanking Roger (ch. 1732), who was undefeated against some of the best horses in the country except for one race where he threw his rider, Roundhead (ch. 1733), Fleec\'em, Steady, and Blaze (b. 1733). Blaze was especially important, producing Sampsom, Scrub and Childers, Shales (founding sire of the Norfolk Roadster, great influence on the Hackney) and Messenger, the founding sire of the Standardbred and very important in the Tennessee Walking Horse. Lastly, Flying Childers was the damsire of the important foundation Thoroughbred sire Herod. He died in 1741, aged 26.[8] It was said he was "the fleetest horse that ever ran at Newmarket or, as generally believed, that was ever bred in the world".[5]'

aS'An Adelaide trolleybus system was part of the public transport network in Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia, for roughly 30 years in the mid-twentieth century. During the Great Depression, Adelaide\'s Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) needed to expand services, but finances prevented laying new tracks. A decision was made to trial trolleybuses, and a converted petrol bus began running experimentally on the Payneham and Paradise lines. The trial was a success, and therefore a permanent system was opened in 1937. The permanent system began operations with a fleet of double-decker trolleybuses running to Tusmore. Extensions to Port Adelaide, Semaphore and Largs Bay were opened in 1938. Trolleybuses continued running in Adelaide until July 1963, when the last line was converted to motor buses.[1] Petrol bus 216 was converted to electric operation and ran from May 1932 to August 1934. It was the first trolleybus in Australia and become known as "The Green Goddess" by its distinctive livery. It seated twenty-three with room for twenty standing passengers.[2] Imported English trolleybus chassis were completed with bodywork by Lawtons of Adelaide in 1937, then numbered as buses 401 to 430. The A.E.C. trolleybuses seated fifty-seven with a crush load of eighty-four and were withdrawn in mid 1957, with a brief return to service in August 1958.[2] With chassis brought in from England prior to World War II, the MTT constructed buses 431 to 435. When put into service in 1942 the Leyland buses were the largest in the MTT fleet and remained so until withdrawn in 1958.[2] As part of the World War II supply effort, English bus chassis, with a final intended destination of the Guangdong province in China, were brought to Adelaide where they remained. The MTT built bodies for them from 1942 to 1944, as buses 501 to 530, with a seating capacity of thirty and a crush load of sixty. The became popularly known as cantons or wombats and remained in service until 1963.[2] Buses 501 to 530 were built by Lawtons of Adelaide on a Sunbeam chassis in late 1951. They seated forty passengers, had a crush load of seventy-seven and were used in services until mid 1963.[2] Media related to Trolleybuses in Adelaide at Wikimedia Commons'

aS'Anthony Christian (b. 24 October 1945 in London, United Kingdom) is a British painter.[1] Starting at the age of 10, child prodigy Anthony Christian studied the techniques of the "Old Masters" at the National Gallery in London. Throughout his time at the National Gallery and for a further seven years Anthony studied the works of Rubens, Rembrandt and other Old Masters. His painting and drawing style most resembles the techniques of Leonardo da Vinci. In his earlier days Anthony earned his living as a portrait artist, painting among others Lord Mountbatten of Burma, Baroness Olympia de Rothschild, Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza, Count Guido di Carpegna, Lord Lichfield, Blake Edwards, Julie Christie and Terence Stamp. His work features in certain private art collections such as Gore Vidal, Baroness Marie-Helene de Rothschild, Viscountess Jacqueline de Ribes, Mrs J Heinz, Bill Blass, HM Queen Elizabeth II, Mrs. James Lipton and Herbie Hancock. His wife, Marian Fanny Christian, is also an artist. Fanny\'s style is probably unique in its form and uninfluenced by Christian\'s work although they sometimes combine their drawing skills to produce beautiful Collaborations In 1957 the newspapers announced Anthony Christian (known at the time as Howard Clanford) as a Child Prodigy since, having started at only ten years of age, he was studying art at The National Gallery, making him the youngest person ever to have permission to copy there. This honour is normally reserved for professional artists and students, but certainly never to anyone under the age of eighteen, making Christian\'s position unique even to this day. For the press that was a story in itself, but the thing that really grabbed their attention was the subject that Christian had chosen to copy and the sheer quality of the painting he was producing. The painting he copied was Philip Wouwermans\' \'A Cavalry Battle\', an extremely large and complicated painting measuring 6 feet by 4 feet 6inches. So daunting was this painting that no other artist had ever attempted to reproduce it, but at only 10 years of age Anthony Christian was doing exactly that. It took him over six years to complete. During that time he had received offers up to 25,000 (in 1957) By the early sixties he was making a name for himself as a portrait painter, receiving commissions from the world\'s rich and famous, which sent him travelling all over the world from New York to Nepal. Come the eighties he had become very well known for his preservation of the Renaissance techniques; Society Magazine referred to him as "the World\'s fore-most Renaissance-style painter". But commissions never pleased him as his clients rarely wanted an image of themselves as his eye saw them, but rather an idealized version themselves. Christian wanted to become a Master of his own unique style that honoured the techniques of the Old Masters, and he realised that he could not achieve this through endless commissions. So he left the mainstream market and sought refuge in Asia, and thus Anthony Christian disappeared from the Western World. He continued to paint in Asia, in fact by being free to his own style and inspiration he became extremely prolific. He experimented with technique and genre creating very inspired works. In 1988 he settled in Bali where he established his first gallery which was extremely popular with clients across Asia. In 1994 he moved to India and found great inspiration in the country\'s landscape and culture, and later established the Ichor Foundation which has now expanded into India\'s center for bio-dynamic farming.

aS"Source: CricketArchive Roger Harman (born December 28, 1941 in Hersham) is a former English first class cricketer. He played with Surrey from 1961 until 1968 and also represented the International Cavaliers during this time. He played in four first-class matches in 1961 and in five the following year. In 1963 he played in 13 fixtures, and took a hat-trick against Kent at Blackheath. With Tony Lock having left Surrey, 1964 was Harman's first full season, and he took 136 wickets at 21.01. His innings figures included 8/12 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and 8/32 against Kent. Towards the end of the season his spin partner was the seventeen-year-old off-spinner Pat Pocock. However he found the high expectations aroused by his success imposed enormous pressure on him, and from that point his performances declined. He managed 63 wickets the following year, 50 in 1966 and only 18 in 1967, by which time he was no longer a first team regular. In 1968 he managed 48 wickets, largely thanks to a spinner-friendly pitch at Ilkeston, where he took 6 for 97 and 8 for 16 (including a hat-trick) against Derbyshire. But four further appearances produced only two more wickets and he was not retained on Surrey's staff at the end of the season."

aS"The Escaped Cock is a short novel by D. H. Lawrence that was originally written in two parts and published in 1929. Lawrence wrote the first part in 1927 after visiting some Etruscan tombs with his friend Earl Brewster, a trip that encouraged the author to reflect upon death and myths of resurrection. The second part was added in 1928 during a stay in Gstaad in Switzerland. The Black Sun Press first published The Escaped Cock as a limited edition in September 1929. The Escaped Cock was always Lawrence's preferred title for this tale but it has also been printed under the title The Man Who Died by some later publishers. In February 1930, the dying Lawrence was negotiating about an unlimited edition with the London publisher, Charles Lahr. Lahr asked for the title to be changed to The Man Who Died and Lawrence eventually agreed, insisting that the original title should be retained as a subtitle. This projected Lahr edition failed to appear and the first English edition was eventually published by Martin Secker in September 1931 as The Man Who Died, a title never approved by the author. The work was illustrated with wood-engravings by John Farleigh. The story is a recasting of the resurrection of Christ narrated in the New Testament. The man who survives his crucifixion comes to celebrate his bodily existence and sensuality. Lawrence himself summarized The Escaped Cock in a letter to Brewster: 'I wrote a story of the Resurrection, where Jesus gets up and feels very sick bout everything, and can't stand the old crowd any more - so cuts out - and as he heals up, he begins to find what an astonishing place the phenomenal world is, far more marvellous than any salvation or heaven - and thanks his stars he needn't have a mission any more.'"

aS'Qwiha (also Kuha or Kwiha) is a town located in northern Ethiopia. The name comes from the local word for willows, which are abundant in the area.[1] Located in the Debub Misraqawi (Southeastern) Zone of the Tigray Region, it lies 9 kilometers east of Mek\'ele straddling the highway that leads to Addis Ababa. It has a latitude and longitude of 132837N 393242E / 13.47694N 39.54500E / 13.47694; 39.54500Coordinates: 132837N 393242E / 13.47694N 39.54500E / 13.47694; 39.54500 with an elevation of 2247 meters above sea level. Qwiha is the administrative center of the Enderta woreda. It had telephone service at least as early as 1956, when it is reported that the only hotel in town had the only telephone.[2] The airport of Mekelle, Alula Aba Nega Airport is located within the administrative boundaries of Qwiha. In Qwiha, the main paved road from Addis Ababa takes a sharp turn left to Mek\'ele. The old road to Asmara, still bearing the "National road n1" label, keeps heading north to the village of Maymagden and Wukro but is not asphalted. A local road starts in Qwiha linking the eastern tabias of Arato and Derge Agen to the woreda center. Seven kilometers south of Qwiha a regional road heading to Shiket and the Afar Region diverts from the national highway. On the northern edge of town are ruins, including a set of monolithic pillars. The ruins were first described by Nathaniel Pearce in the early 19th century, which included the presence of inscriptions. he also mentions the presence of a sacred spring whose waters "afflicted with disease resort from far and near to bathe."[1] There is also a tradition that the ruins were part of a church dedicated to the Ethiopian saint Chirqos and destroyed by Imam Ahmad Gragn. Although no other remains of this structure has been recorded, a more recent church stands nearby and "grave digging has exposed rough walls and possibly Aksumite pottery."[3] The Guido describes Qwiha in 1938, during the Italian occupation, as having a small Italian settlement below the center of town, and little north of the pass a small church of San Francesco da Pola built by an Italian military unit.[2] The town was occupied by the Woyane during their rebellion against the Ethiopian government in late 1943.[4] Based on figures from the Central Statistical Agency in 2005, Qwiha has an estimated total population of 12,543, of whom 5,644 were males and 6,899 were females.[5] The 1994 census reported it had a total population of 9,867 of whom 4,336 were males and 5,531 were females. It is one of two towns in Enderta woreda.'

aS'Vino de Pago (VP, sometimes also referred to as Denominacin de Pago or DO Pago) is a classification for Spanish wine (similar to the French appellations) applied to individual vineyards or wine estates, unlike the Denominacin de Origen (DO) or Denominacin de Origen Calificada (DOCa) which is applied to an entire wine region. The Vino de Pago classification was introduced in 2003 by a decision in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, to help further improve the quality of Spanish wine. As of 2012, there were 13 Vinos de Pago.[1] The quality requirements for a Vino de Pago correspond to those for a DOCa wine, and wine estates that are classified as Vino de Pago are subject to separate requirements rather than those of the wine region where they are located.[2] One of the requirements is that the estate may only use their own grapes for their wines. The Spanish word pago comes from the Latin word pagus, meaning a country district. When introduced, the new regulation met with particular interest in Castilla-La Mancha, where the first Vinos de Pago were created.[3] So far, all Vinos de Pago are located in Castilla-La Mancha, Navarra and Valencia.[1]'

aS'Turkish is a highly agglutinative language, i.e., Turkish words have many grammatical suffixes or endings that determine meaning. Turkish vowels undergo vowel harmony. When a suffix is attached to a stem, the vowel in the suffix agrees in frontness or backness and in roundedness with the last vowel in the stem. Turkish has no gender. A suffix (ek) is attached to a stem (gvde). A stem may be a root (kk) or further analyzable. The suffixes used in Turkish fall roughly into two classes: constructive suffixes (yapm ekleri) and inflectional suffixes (ekim ekleri). A constructive suffix makes a new word from an old one, that is, it is a derivational suffix. An inflectional suffix indicates how a word is used in a sentence. The article on Turkish grammar pertains chiefly to inflectional suffixes. The article on Turkish vocabulary treats the constructive suffixes. A Turkish suffix can be called enclitic if its vowel undergoes vowel harmony, agreeing with the last vowel of the stem the suffix is attached to. Turkish is a gender-neutral language except for a few sex-specific compound words (mostly naming professions). English third person singular pronouns "she", "he", and "it" all correspond to a single Turkish pronoun o. Since many given names in Turkish are also gender-neutral, it is possible to describe someone without their sex being made known. Turkish has a strong T-V distinction and usage of honorifics. Turkish uses second-person pronouns that distinguish varying levels of politeness, social distance, age, courtesy or familiarity toward the addressee. The plural second-person pronoun and verb forms are used referring to a single person out of respect, as is done in French and Russian. Family members and friends speak to one another using the second singular person "sen", and adults use "sen" to address minors. In formal situations (meeting people for the first time, business, customer-clerk, colleagues) plural second-person "siz" is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, double plural second-person "sizler" may be used to refer to a much-respected person. Rarely, third person plural conjugation of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. In the imperative, there are three forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and double plural second person for very formal situations: "gel" (second person singular, informal), "gelin" (second person plural, formal), "geliniz" (double second person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used. Turkish honorifics generally follow the first name, especially if they refer to gender or particular social statuses (e.g. Name Bey (Mr.), Name Hanm (Ms.), Name Hoca (teacher or cleric)). Such honorifics are used both in formal and informal situations. A newer honorific is "Sayn," which precedes the surname or full name, and is not gender-specific. (e.g. Sayn Name Surname, or Sayn Surname). They are generally used in very formal situations. In the Turkish terms for the constructive and inflectional endings, three roots are involved: For the last two verbal roots, the constructive suffix -im can be added to form nouns for instances of the actions denoted by the roots: Either of these nouns can be compounded with the noun ek, resulting in an indefinite compound (belirtisiz tamlama), the sign of which is the inflectional suffix -i attached to ek: The inflectional suffix -ler comes before the -i to form the plural, so yapm ekleri, ekim ekleri. Many words in Turkishparticularly many grammatical termsare neologisms invented to replace earlier words borrowed from Arabic or Persian. (See the main article on Turkish language.) In some cases, the older term continues to be in used alongside the neologism. There are nine parts of speech (sz trleri "word-kinds") in Turkish. Postpositions are analogous to prepositions in English, only they follow their objects. Postpositions can be reckoned as particles. However, there are particles in Turkish that are not postpositions. Only nouns, pronouns and verbs are inflected in Turkish. An adjective can usually be treated as a noun or pronoun, in which case it can also be inflected. Inflection can give a noun features of a verb such as person and tense. With inflection, a verb can become one of the following: These have peculiarities not shared with other nouns, adjectives or adverbs. For example, some participles take a person the way verbs do. Also, a verbal noun or adverb can take a direct object. Some verbal nouns are not inflected forms in Turkish, but are borrowed from Arabic or other languages. A noun or pronoun alone can make a complete sentence. For example, Most dictionaries list verbs in their infinitive form, which alone usually cannot form complete sentences. For example, However, instead of the infinitive, the Redhouse TurkishEnglish Dictionary gives the stem of a verb as its headword, and the present article follows this convention. The verb-stem is also the second-person singular imperative: Both a noun and a verb, without endings, can alone form a sentence. Many verbs are formed from nouns by addition of -le. For example, The aorist tense of a verb is formed by adding -(i/e)r. The plural of a noun is formed by suffixing -ler. Hence: Thus -ler can indicate either a plural noun or a finite verb. Most adjectives can be treated as nouns or pronouns. For example, An adjective or noun can stand, as a modifier, before a noun. If the modifier is a noun (but not a noun of material), then the second noun word takes the inflectional suffix -i: Comparison of adjectives is not done by inflecting adjectives or adverbs, but by other means (described below). Adjectives can serve as adverbs, sometimes by means of repetition: Turkish is generally SOV. A general rule of Turkish word-order is that the modifier precedes the modified: Also, in a sentence, However, because the distinction between subject, indirect object, and direct object is also indicated with inflection, Turkish word order can vary. The order of morphemes in Turkish is often opposite to English: Avrupa Avrupal Avrupalla Avrupallatr Avrupallatrama Avrupallatramadk Avrupallatramadklar Avrupallatramadklarmz Avrupallatramadklarmzdan Avrupallatramadklarmzdan m? Avrupallatramadklarmzdan msn? Avrupallatramadklarmzdan msnz? Europe European become European (command) Europeanize (command) I wish you could not Europeanize we could not Europeanize those whom could not Europeanize those whom we could not Europeanize one of those whom we could not Europeanize Is S/he one of those whom we could not Europeanize? Are you one of those whom we could not Europeanize? Are you one of those whom we could not Europeanize? (second plural or formal) Within the same context, the longest Turkish word consists of 44 characters: ekoslovakyallatramadklarmzdanmsnz = You are apparently one of those we weren\'t (or haven\'t been) able to make a Czechoslovakian. (And equally: skandinavyallatramadklarmzdanmsnz = same for a Scandinavian.)[longest Turkish word: in Turkish "Mvaffakiyetsizletiriciletiriveremeyebileceklerimizdenmisinizcesine", which means something like (you are talking) as if you are one of those that we can not easily convert into an unsuccessful-person-maker (someone who un-educates people to make them unsuccessful)]. The plural suffix (oul eki) can be used with nouns and with third-person verbs: The case-endings (durum ekleri from dur- "stop, last", or hl ekleri from hl "state, condition") can be named (in English) and used roughly as in Latin: If a case-ending is attached to a demonstrative pronoun (which ends in o or u), or to a noun that has already taken a third-person ending of possession (given below), then the case-ending is preceded by n (and the parenthetical y is not used). Nouns derived from verbs in several ways. The number of ways of forming verbal nouns (fiil isimleri) from verb-stems can be debated; here are three: Several series of endings show distinctions of person (kii); they are given here, along with the personal pronouns for comparison: The names given to the personal endings here are not standard. These endings are often just referred to as type I, II, III, and IV respectively; but the order in which the types are numbered is also not standard. It should also be noted that Lewis (1967) refers to the suffixes of possession as "personal" endings. However, of the endings called personal in Turkish and in this article: In the 3rd person, plural number is not always explicitly marked, and the same form is used for both singular and plural. If the plural suffix -ler is used, it combines with the personal endings as indicated in the final column of the table. A suffix of possession gives the person of a possessor of the object named by the noun to which the suffix is attached; it also indicates a subject for a participle. A predicative ending can assign a person to a noun, thus creating a complete sentence: See also Copula#Turkish and Turkish copula. All of the personal suffixes can be used in the formation of verbs. Verb-stems have been mentioned. A verb-base is obtained from a verb-stem by attachment of certain suffixes or characteristics given below. Then the personal endings here called "predicative" and "verbal" attach only to verb-bases; the optative and imperative endings attach to verb-stems. The present characteristic is not fully enclitic: the first syllable shows vowel harmony, but the second is invariable. The aorist negative and impotential characteristics are given here because they are anomalous. Note, that the "-z" of the aorist negative (-mez) and impotential (-(y)emez) is dropped in the 1st person singular and plural, in order to be able to suffix it. (Aorist negative 1st person singular: -mem; BUT: Aorist impotential 3rd person plural: -(y)emezler) The non-aorist characteristics can be suffixed to the following endings: See #Negation and potential in verb-stems under #Verbs below. Some third-person verbs are also participles. Participles can be classified as personal, if they take a suffix of possession, and impersonal, if they do not. The following suffixes attach to verb-stems: The interrogative particle (soru eki) is not written as a suffix, but it is enclitic: A Turkish noun has no gender. The dictionary-form of a noun can take up to four (kinds of) #Inflectional suffixes, generally in the following order: Through its presence or absence, the plural ending shows distinctions of number. A noun is made into an indefinite plural by addition of -ler. If a numeral is used with a noun, then the plural suffix is usually not used: The plural ending also allows a family (living in one house) to be designated by a single member: In the last example, the first-person singular suffix of possession comes before the plural ending; this is an exception to the order of suffixes given above. In the usual order, we have Nouns are pluralized in standard temporal greetings. As noted earlier, the suffixes of possession give the person (and number) of the possessor of what is named by the noun: Note well that, when a word takes one of the endings of possession, the word becomes the name of something possessed, not possessing: the word for the possessor, if present, takes the genitive case-ending, as discussed below. The plural ending will not be attached twice to the same word; therefore ambiguity is possible: Ambiguity can be resolved with #Pronouns. The absolute case combines the uses of the nominative, vocative, and (in part) accusative cases. It is for subjects, and for names of people being addressed. It is also used for indefinite direct objects. Definite direct objects are in the definite-accusative case: The dative case tells whither, that is, the place to which. Thus it has roughly the meaning of the English prepositions "to" and "into", and also "in" when it can be replaced with "into": The dative also is for objects: usually indirect objects, but sometimes objects that in English would be considered direct: The locative case tells where, hence corresponds to the English prepositions "at" and "on", and "in" when it does not mean "into". The ablative case tells whence, that is, the place from which (or through which), hence: In the Turkish terminology, the genitive case indicates a "compounding" (tamlayan) word. The corresponding "compounded" (tamlanan) word will take the appropriate suffix of possession. The pair of these words is then a definite compound (belirtili tamlama): (The apostrophe in Turkish is used before suffixes attached to proper nouns.) However, if two nouns are connected, but not by ownership, then the second noun generally takes an ending of possession, while the first takes no ending. The result is an indefinite compound (belirtisiz tamlama): If one noun names a material, the other noun need not take an ending: If a noun is to be in the first or second person, one of the predicative suffixes (or type-I personal suffixes) will show this: In the third person, no ending is required. However, the ending -dir can be used; it is said (Lewis, 1967: VIII,3) to be the remnant of a verb turur "S/he stands". Again in the third person, the plural suffix may be used: Several suffixes can be combined: (The last was spotted on a minibus in Turkey.) The infinitive, formed with -mek as noted earlier, does not take a suffix of possession, or the genitive case-ending. It does take all other case-endings. In particular, the progressive characteristic given earlier is the infinitive ending with the locative ending: The verbal noun in -me is called a gerund above, since it corresponds roughly to the English gerund. It can take a suffix of possession and any case-ending: The dative form of a Turkish gerund can correspond precisely to an English infinitive with to: that is, "Nano-technological products began to be produced in our country" (source: Cumhuriyet Bilim-Teknik 13 August 2005, p.1). Yet another verbal noun is from -i: The verb et- "make, do" can be considered as an auxiliary verb, since for example it is often used with verbal nouns borrowed from other languages, such as Arabic: Considered as units, these are transitive verbs; but the nouns in them can, by themselves, take direct objects: What looks like an ablative gerund is usually an adverb; the ending -meden usually has the sense of "without". See #Adverbs below. An infinitive in the absolute case can be the object of a verb such as iste- "want": that is, "Some want to continue their educations, and some want to work" (source: Cumhuriyet Pazar Dergi, 14 August 2005, p.1.) Note here that the compound verb devam et- "continue, last" does not take a direct object, but is complemented by a dative noun. Another way to express obligation (besides with lzm as in the earlier example) is by means of zor "trouble, compulsion" and an infinitive: (Source: same as the last example.) Both an infinitive and a gerund are objects of the postposition iin "for" in the third sentence of the quotation within the following quotation: (Source: Cumhuriyet, 9 August 2005, Tuesday, p.1.) A free translation is: The facility authorities said, "The people of this district [namely Edremit, Van] are generally conservative. They cannot enter the lake comfortably, because the shore areas are near the road. So we are using a screen, both to close off the view of passersby on the road, and so that men will not cause discomfort." However, children cannot be prevented from spying on the other side through gaps in the screen. Certain verbs in Turkish are used to enhance the meaning of other verbs, or to agglutinate verbs from nouns. These verbs are called auxiliary verbs. A concise list follows: Verbs that are used with nouns to agglutinate new verbs Examples If there is a change in the noun root through the process of agglutination, it is written adjacently.These are mostly Arabic loan-words, which switch to their more original form. Remember that in Turkish words, two consonants of a syllable need a vowel to be pronunciated. There are exceptions on loan words only, but those that lost their original form are more common. This occurs in two ways: If two identical consonants exist in the end of the word, one is dropped such as hall "state,status" to hal, aff "amnesty,forgiving" to af. If any two consonants exist in one syllable, a vowel appears such as hkm "judgement" to hkm. Exceptions: taht "throne", renk "colour", kart "card" frequent for the ones with nk, rt, rk. Note that most of these are loan-words from Persian or western languages. Examples Verbs that are used with other verbs to enhance the meaning Examples Adjectives used attributively precede the noun; used predicatively, they follow, unless something other than word-order shows that they are being used predicatively: In a positive comparison, the object takes the ablative case; the adverb daha "more" is optional, unless the object is left out. In a negative comparison, the adverb az "less" is needed; the object still takes the ablative; daha can still be used as well. The superlative degree is expressed by the adverb en "most". Most adjectives in the dictionary are descriptive. The most fundamental descriptive adjectives are two: These are used only predicatively: (This is a proverbial expression: "The honey-seller has a honey-pot; the wood-cutter has an axe"; bal "honey", odun "(fire) wood", tas "bowl", balta "axe"; the more usual order would make the saying Balcnn bal tas var, oduncunun baltas var). The cardinal bir "one" can be used as an indefinite article. Word-order can make the difference: Unless it is being used by itself, elliptically, the adjective hi "no" requires an additional word with negative force: It is noted under #Parts of speech that Turkish participles (sfat-fiiller) can be classified as In a personal participle, the suffix of possession signifies the subject of the underlying verb; if this possessor is third person, then the possessor may be further specified with a noun in the genitive case. The noun modified by a personal participle as an adjective may be the direct object of the underlying verb; the connexion may also be more vague. The noun modified by an impersonal participle is generally the subject of the underlying verb (but see Lewis (1967: IX,2)). The aorist tense (geni zaman "broad time") is for habitual actions; the present tense (imdiki zaman "time that is now") is for actions ongoing or contemplated. Aorist: Present: that is, "No legal process has begun concerning the AKP members who pulled out guns and fired them in the air" [Birgn Halkn Gazetesi, 25 July 2005]; for -ip see #Adverbs below. Future: Past/present: (The last example is a newspaper headline [Birgn, 20 July 2005] about cemetery workers; bit- "end"; yer "place"; hayat [Arabic] and yaam [neologism from yaa-] "life".) A personal participle can be construed as a noun and used in parallel with verbal nouns: (Source: Birgn Halkn Gazetesi 13 August 2005, Saturday, p.1.) That is, Children are working, 68% to provide for their family\'s needs, 21% because their family wants it, 6% to learn a job or profession, 4% to meet their [own] needs. The following sentence from a newspaper headline contains twenty-two words, nine derived from verbs, four of these as participles, three as gerunds. Note also the use of kontrol from French as a verbal noun with et-: Source: Cumhuriyet, 17 July 2005; more smoothly: Saying that, by not joining the EU and by drawing close to the Islamic world, Turkey would be pushed into the lap of those who favor sharia, French senator Duireux made clear that it was necessary to control the Islamic tide. The adverb of negation is deil. It is used to negate sentences that are without verb or var; then it takes the appropriate personal ending: It may also negate part of sentence: (slogan on placard at demonstration). A number of adverbs are derived from verbs: The ending -e is seen in: The ending -erek denotes action at the same time as, or preceding, that of another verb: [the latter is Blent Ecevit as quoted in Cumhuriyet, 20 July 2005]. [Buday magazine, 78/2005, no 32]. From ol- "be, become", olarak forms adverbial phrases corresponding to those in English with "as": The ending -meden on a verb-stem looks like the ablative gerund, but it is not (Lewis [XI,12]). It indicates an action not occurring at all, or following that of the main verb: (Source of the last sentence: Joseph Joubert as quoted on p.20 of Gndelik Bilmeceler by Partha Ghose and Dipankar Home, translated by zlem zbal, Tbitak Popler Bilim Kitaplar 25, Ankara, 1996.) Complementing nce "before" is sonra "after", which can follow a verb-stem given the ending -dikten: Simultaneity is expressed by iken or its (not enclitic) suffixed form -(y)ken; but if it follows a verb, then the verb appears, not as a stem, but as a base; see #Bases of verbs: If two verbs of the same grammatical form have the same subject, the endings on the first verb can be replaced by -ip; see the example under #Participles. The third-person personal pronoun o "she/he/it" is declined as if it were the noun on. The other persons, ben "I", sen "you (singular/informal)", biz "we", siz "you (plural/formal)", are declined like nouns, except for a vowel change in the dative, and an anomalous genitive; also the plural forms do not involve -ler: The absolute case is generally needed only for emphasis: The third-person pronoun can clear up an ambiguity mentioned above: The pronoun o is also one of the demonstrative pronouns: The latter two are declined like o (that is, treated as if they were bun and un). The interrogative pronouns (and adjectives) are: These serve as relative pronouns only in a limited way: There is a suffix -ki, borrowed from Persian, that acts as a relative pronoun in that it creates what, in English, would be called relative clauses. It does not display vowel harmony, except in a few common formations: The reflexive pronoun (dnl zamir from dn- "turn") is kendi "own, self": Many of the indefinite adjectives can function as pronouns, taking case-endings. Many stems in the dictionary are indivisible; others consist of endings attached to a root. The verb-stem temizle- "make clean" is the adjective temiz "clean" with the suffix -le; this suffix was mentioned earlier under #Parts of speech in connexion with the verb kpekle-. Many verbs are formed from nouns or adjectives with -le: A verbal root, or a verb-stem in -le, can be lengthened with certain extensions. If present, they appear in the following order; they indicate distinctions of voice: These endings might seem to be inflectional in the sense of the #Introduction above, but their meanings are not always clear from their particular names, and dictionaries do generally give the resulting forms, so in this sense they are constructive endings. The causative extension makes an intransitive verb transitive, and a transitive verb factitive. Together, the reciprocal and causative extension make the repetitive extension -itir. A dictionary-stem is positive; it can be made: Any of these three (kinds of) stems can be made potential by addition of -e and then -bil. The -bil is not enclitic, but represents the verb bil- "know, be able"; the first syllable of the impotential ending represents an obsolete verb u- "be powerful, able" #Lewis [VIII,55]. So far then, there are six kinds of stems: Such stems are not used for aorist forms, which have their own peculiar means of forming negatives and impotentials. The characteristics with which verb-bases are formed from stems are given under #Inflectional suffixes. Note again that aorist verbs have their own peculiar negative and impotential forms. The progressive base in -mekte is discussed under #Verbal nouns. Another base, namely the necessitative (gereklilik), is formed from a verbal noun. The characteristic is -meli, where -li forms adjectives from nouns, and -me forms gerunds from verb-stems. A native speaker may perceive the ending -meli as indivisible; the analysis here is from #Lewis [VIII,30]). The present base is derived from the ancient verb yor- "go, walk" #Lewis [VIII,16]; this can be used for ongoing actions, or for contemplated future actions. The meaning of the aorist base is described under #Adjectives from verbs: participles. There is some irregularity in first-person negative and impotential aorists. The full form of the base -mez (or (y)emez) reappears before the interrogative particle mi: The definite past or di-past is used to assert that something did happen in the past. The inferential past or mi-past can be understood as asserting that a past participle is applicable now; hence it is used when the fact of a past event, as such, is not important; in particular, the inferential past is used when one did not actually witness the past event. A newspaper will generally use the di-past, because it is authoritative. The need to indicate uncertainly and inference by means of the mi-past may help to explain the extensive use of ki in the newspaper excerpt at Turkish vocabulary#The conjunction ki. The conditional (art) verb could also be called "hypothetical"; it is used for remote possibilities, or things one might wish for. (See also #Compound bases.) The various bases thus give distinctions of tense, aspect and mood. These can be briefly tabulated: The interrogative particle mi precedes predicative (type-I) endings (except for the 3rd person plural -ler), but follows the complete verb formed from a verbal, type-II ending: Usually, in the optative (istek), only the first-person forms are used, and these supply the lack of a first-person imperative (emir). In common practice then, there is one series of endings to express something wished for: -(y)eyim, -(y)elim, , -(y)in, -sin. (The longer second-person plural imperative ending -(y) iniz is generally used only in writing.) The ancient verb er- #Lewis [VIII,2] exists in Turkish in three bases: The form iken given under #Adverbs from verbs is also descended from er-. Since no more bases are founded on the stem i-, this verb can be called defective. In particular, i- forms no negative or impotential stems; negation is achieved with the #Adverb of negation, deil, given earlier. Verbs i- are often made into suffixes; the corresponding bases then are where the y is used only after vowels. The verb i- serves as a copula. When a copula is needed, but the appropriate base in i- does not exist, then the corresponding base in ol- is used; this stem otherwise means "become". The verb i- is irregular in the way it is used in questions: the particle mi always precedes it: The bases so far considered can be called "simple". A base in i- can be attached to another base, forming a compound base. One can then interpret the result by reading backwards. The following list is representative, not exhaustive: By means of ise or -(y)se, a verb can be made conditional in the sense of being the hypothesis or protasis of a complex statement: The simple conditional can be used for remote conditions:'

aS'Cimmeria was an ancient microcontinent that existed about 200 million years ago. It rifted north from Gondwana during the Late Carboniferous and collided against eastern Laurasia (the Siberian continent) during the Late Triassic together with the Chinese continents. The collision created new mountain ranges between Siberia and Cimmeria. Cimmeria consisted of parts of Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Tibet, Indochina and Malaya. Cimmeria was on the Cimmerian Plate, an ancient tectonic plate that was subducting under Laurasia. The present remains of Cimmeria, as a result of the massive uplifting of its continental crust, are unusually rich in a number of rare chalcophile elements. Apart from the Altiplano in Bolivia, almost all the worlds deposits of antimony as stibnite are found in Cimmeria, with the major mines being in Turkey, Yunnan and Thailand. The major deposits of tin are also found in Malaysia and Thailand, whilst Turkey also has major deposits of chromite ore.

aS'Moku Manu, or "Bird Island" in the Hawaiian language, is an offshore islet of Oahu, three-quarters of a mile off Mokapu Peninsula. Moku Manu and an adjacent small islet are connected by an underwater dike. The island was formed from debris flung from a vent of the nearby Kailua Volcano. Its highest point is 202 feet high, bordered by near-vertical cliffs on many sides. Moku Manu is protected as a state seabird sanctuary like its neighbors to the south, Manana, Kohikaipu, and Mklea Rock. Regardless, landing by boat is nearly impossible due to the lack of a safe beach. Moku Manu\'s isolated nature makes it an excellent nesting site. Eleven species of seabirds nest on Moku Manu, along with several migrating shorebirds. Coordinates: 212812N 1574312W / 21.47000N 157.72000W / 21.47000; -157.72000'

aS'The Clouded-bordered Brindle (Apamea crenata) is a moth of the family Noctuidae. It is distributed throughout the Palearctic ecozone. This species has a wingspan of 36 to 44mm. The forewings are pale brown with darker patches around the margin, usually with especially prominent markings at the base and tornus. The hindwings are greyish with darker venation. Melanic forms occur fairly frequently. This moth flies at night and is attracted to light and sugar and especially to nectar-rich flowers. In the British Isles it is active from May to July. The larva feeds on various grasses including orchard grasses, tussock grasses, fescues, and canarygrasses. This species overwinters as a larva and feeds in mild weather throughout the season.[1] '

aS'The Banjo-Kazooie series features a constant set of characters, with only a few additions made with each game. Said additions are mostly limited to supporting characters, while the main protagonists always remain Banjo and Kazooie, opposed by the antagonist Gruntilda. The only constant change is that of the duo\'s mentor, with Bottles in Banjo-Kazooie, his brother Jamjars in Banjo-Tooie and their ancestor Bozzeye in Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty\'s Revenge. In Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, this role is occupied by the Lord of Games. Since most characters appear since the first game, a lot of the dialogue or humor in later games is made by referring to previous games or events. The only playable characters in the single player mode of each game are Banjo and Kazooie, with Mumbo being playable in Banjo-Tooie. The multiplayer of Banjo-Tooie allows the player to also control other characters such as Jamjars, Humba or Gruntilda. The spin-off Banjo-Pilot features some of the cast racing against each other, while Banjo and Kazoooie have also appeared in some games outside the series. Since within the series timeline, Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty\'s Revenge is set between Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, the biographies of characters involved in all three games will be structured according to the aforementioned timeline. Banjo the Honey Bear is a brown bear inhabiting Spiral Mountain. He made his video game debut in the racing game Diddy Kong Racing a few months before the release of Banjo-Kazooie. In the former, he receives a phone call from his friend Diddy Kong to help him fight the evil wizard Wizpig. He used to be content with his quiet and peaceful way of life but his sister Tooty and best friend Kazooie convince him to go on an adventure. The day said adventure is set to start; however, his little sister is kidnapped by Gruntilda for her beauty and Banjo is forced to save her by entering Gruntilda\'s lair and collect jiggys to reach the top of the tower. With the help of his friend Kazooie he is able to complete the worlds within the castle and save his sister and throw Gruntilda from the top of the tower, burying her under a large rock. In Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty\'s Revenge, set 2 months later, Banjo has to travel back in time after Gruntilda transferred her soul in a robot, kidnapped Kazooie and time-traveled 20 years into the past to prevent the two from ever meeting. After the time travel, Banjo is already being expected by Bozzeye, who was informed by Mumbo, who mentores him through the first two worlds, after which Kazooie is retrieved. The two reunite and free the other worlds from Grunty\'s control and confront her in her lair, destroying her host body and forcing her to travel back to present into her original body, preventing her from altering the past. After that, Banjo enjoys peace in Spiral Mountain until two years after Banjo-Kazooie, Gruntilda\'s sister Blobbelda and Mingella arrive, freeing Gruntilda from her prison. The three wreck havoc on the Island o\' Hags, where Spiral Mountain lies, and suck out the life force out of the inhabitants, killing Bottles. Banjo and Kazooie once again set out to stop the witch and avenge their friend. This time, they have to fight their way through the entire island and confront the witch on the top of Cauldron Keep. Gruntilda is once again defeated and life and peace on the island are restored. Eight years pass between Banjo-Tooie and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts. In this time, Banjo and Kazooie fixed half of their house but mostly ate pizza and slept, becoming lazy and obese. Gruntilda\'s skull returns to Spiral Mountain and challenges the two to a final duel to determine the true owner of the land. The Lord of Games, annoyed by their pityful performances, appears and offers to let them have a true challenge in a world he created, Showdown Town. While the winner gains Spiral Mountain\'s deeds, the loser has to work in L.O.G.\'s factory for the rest of his life. He restores their physical fitness but takes away their moves and they once again have to make their way through several worlds to confront Gruntilda in a final challenge. Once again defeating her, the two win the deed\'s for Spiral Mountain. Banjo\'s personality is portrayed as easygoing, friendly, wise, peaceful and polite, always trying to solve problems diplomatically and apologizing for Kazooie\'s behaviour. However, he is also quite lazy and lacks courage, refusing to go on adventures and becoming obese in the time between Banjo-Tooie and Nuts and Bolts. Banjo is named after the eponymous instrument and also plays it. In Grunty\'s Revenge and Banjo-Tooie, he is able to separate himself from his partner, while most of his moves involve his backpack. In Nuts and Bolts, he operates the vehicles while Kazooie uses the magical wrench. He appears as a playable character in Banjo-Pilot and Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. Kazooie the red-crested Breegull is a bird of the fictional breegull species and Banjo\'s best friend. She always tried to convince him to go on an adventure. After she finally succeeds, Banjo\'s little sister Tooty is kidnapped by Gruntilda for her beauty and Banjo is forced to save her by entering Gruntilda\'s lair and collect jiggys to reach the top of the tower. Kazooie assists him and together they are able to complete the worlds within the castle and save Banjo\'s sister and throw Gruntilda from the top of the tower, burying her under a large rock. In Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty\'s Revenge, set 2 months later, Gruntilda transferred her soul in a robot and kidnaps Kazooie to time-travel 20 years into the past with her to prevent the two from ever meeting. She is held hostage in Breegull Beach until Banjo comes to save her. The two reunite and free the other worlds from Grunty\'s control and confront her in her lair, destroying her host body and forcing her to travel back to present into her original body, preventing her from altering the past. After that, Kazooie enjoys peace in Spiral Mountain until two years after Banjo-Kazooie, Gruntilda\'s sister Blobbelda and Mingella arrive, freeing Gruntilda from her prison. The three wreck havoc on the Island o\' Hags, where Spiral Mountain lies, and suck out the life force out of the inhabitants, killing Bottles. Banjo and Kazooie once again set out to stop the witch and avenge their friend. This time, they have to fight their way through the entire island and confront the witch on the top of Cauldron Keep. Gruntilda is once again defeated and life and peace on the island are restored. Eight years pass between Banjo-Tooie and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts. In this time, Banjo and Kazooie fixed half of their house but mostly ate pizza and slept, becoming lazy and obese. Gruntilda\'s skull returns to Spiral Mountain and challenges the two to a final duel to determine the true owner of the land. The Lord of Games, annoyed by their pitiful performances, appears and offers to let them have a true challenge in a world he created, Showdown Town. While the winner gains Spiral Mountain\'s deeds, the loser has to work in L.O.G.\'s factory for the rest of his life. He restores their physical fitness but takes away their moves, much to her dismay, and they once again have to make their way through several worlds to confront Gruntilda in a final challenge. Once again defeating her, the two win the deed\'s for Spiral Mountain. Unlike Banjo, Kazooie is rude and foul-mouthed, frequently provoking and insulting others, especially her mole mentors (who often give her nicknames as well). She is also shown to be brave and rather reckless, never shying away from a fight. Hence her name, she plays the kazoo. In Grunty\'s Revenge and Banjo-Tooie, she is able to separate herself from Banjo, enabling her to run faster and jump farther. In Nuts and Bolts, she uses the magical wrench, while Banjo operates the vehicles. She appears as a playable character in Banjo-Pilot and Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. Bottles the Mole is Banjo and Kazooie\'s tutor in the first game. He eyewitnesses Tooty\'s capture and being of her best friends, he assists Banjo and Kazooie in freeing her by teaching them new moves. In Banjo-Tooie, he is killed by Gruntilda\'s magicial spells when he refuses to take shelter, believing Mumbo\'s report to be a fraud. He then waits in front of Banjo and Kazooie\'s house as a ghost until he is brought back to life, with his brother Jamjars taking over as tutor. In Nuts and Bolts, he is turned into a Showdown Town tour guide by L.O.G. He is revealed to have a wife and two children, Speccy and Googles, in Banjo-Tooie but his family has left him by the time of Nuts and Bolts, being unable to cope with his death and resurrection. He does not get along with Kazooie at all, with the two frequently insulting and provoking one another. He is a playable character in Banjo-Pilot, being the most effective driver in the game. Mumbo Jumbo is a shaman and a close friend of Banjo and Kazooie. His past largely remains a mystery but he frequently states that he was the best student at the Handsome Shaman Institute. He used to be Gruntilda\'s teacher in the art of magic but she turned to dark magic and transformed his head into a skull. Mumbo first appears in Banjo-Kazooie as the "best shaman in all game". Found in multiple worlds starting in Mumbo\'s Mountain, he transformed Banjo and Kazooie into animals and plants in return for Mumbo Tokens, as Mumbo wanted to help the bear and bird beat Grunty to get his face back. Despite Grunty being buried under a large boulder, Mumbo\'s face remained a skull. Mumbo remained a friend of Banjo, while he and Kazooie got into dust-ups. When Kazooie is kidnapped and taken into the past by Grunty in Grunty\'s Revenge, Mumbo sends Banjo back in time, too and informs Bozzeye and his past self by sending letters back in time as well. The mumbo from the past assumes a similar role as in the first game and helps the two by transforming them. In Banjo-Tooie, his role largely differs from the first game, as transformations are taken over by Humba Wumba. He can now be controlled by the player himself and is found in every level, where he can unleash a specific spell like healing the yellow sickly Styracosaurus named Scrat. In the beginning of the game he eyewitnesses Grunty\'s resurrection and warns the others to take shelter. After Gruntilda was defeated once more, his face still remained a skull. In Nuts and Bolts his role is once more changed drastically, as he is turned into a car mechanic who runs his own garage by L.O.G. He builds cars for Banjo and Kazooie. He also appears in different roles in L.O.G.\'s worlds, much to his dismay. While generally helpful, he carries a huge grudge against Humba Wumba and sometimes gets into fights with Kazooie. He also appears as a playable character in Banjo-Pilot. Drill Sergeant Jamjars the Mole is Bottle\'s brother and takes over his duties as mentor after his brother\'s death in the beginning of Banjo-Tooie. Like Bottles, he does not get along with Kazooie but displays a more militaristic and strict behaviour towards the duo in general. He does not reside in molehills but in hatches and teaches new moves in rhymes to a marching song. In Nuts and Bolts, he has become the MC of Spiral Mountain\'s local radio station and tells the duo how their appearance looks like since the time of their first game. Humba Wumba is a female Native-American shaman and introduced as Mumbo\'s rival in Banjo-Tooie and carries a huge grudge towards him. She takes over the role of transforming Banjo and Kazooie in the various worlds, residing in a wigwam, into many creatures including a stonie, a detonator, a van, a submarine, a T-Rex, a washing machine, a snowball, and a bee. In Nuts and Bolts, L.O.G. has turned her into a saleswoman for blueprints and vehicle parts. She also appears as a playable character in Banjo-Pilot. Bozzeye the Mole is an ancestor of Bottles and Jamjars who inhabited Spiral Mountain 20 years ago. He is informed of Banjo travelling back in time by Mumbo and mentors Banjo and Kazooie during the events of Grunty\'s Revenge. He is old, has a long white beard and two lazy eyes, a fact that Kazooie frequently mocks him for. The Lord of Games, often referred to as L.O.G., is the lord of all videogaming and as such has created every videogame. Within the gaming world, he has omnipotence, being able to stop time, create new worlds in an instant and ascribe new jobs to video game characters. He is sick and tired of the ongoing rivalry between Banjo, Kazooie and Grunty and, being annoyed by their pitiful performances in the opening of Nuts and Bolts, offers them a final competition in a new world he created: Showdown Town. The opponents have to fight through other worlds he created, while the winner gains the deed\'s for Spiral Mountain, with the loser having to work an eternity in his video game fabric. He restores Banjo and Kazooie\'s fitness, gives them a magical wrench and gives Gruntilda an artificial body and a new sidekick, Piddles. To make the contest more fair, he takes away Banjo and Kazooie\'s moves as well as Grunty\'s magic. Also, he imposes new jobs in Showdown Town on some other characters from the series. He appears as a referee in the final showdown for Spiral Mountain and congratulates Banjo and Kazooie on their victory. Gruntilda the Witch, commonly referred to as Grunty, is the main antagonist of the series. She lives in a tower resembling her head and is stylized as a stereotypical evil witch. Her outward appearance changes drastically with each game, while she has green skin in the first part, she is skeletonized by the time of Banjo-Tooie due to the amount of time spend underground since the first game. In Nuts and Bolts, only her skull remains but she is granted an artificial body by L.O.G., resembling her original one with a jar for her skull. In Grunty\'s Revenge, she transfers her soul into a giant robot build by Klungo and is referred to as Mecha-Grunty. In every game except Banjo-Tooie, she talks solely in rhyme form, with her sisters forbidding her to rhyme in the second game. In the beginning of Banjo-Kazooie, she kidnaps Banjo\'s little sister Tooty, as she wants to steal her with a machine to become as beautiful herself, as she does not tolerate people being more good-looking then her. As Banjo and Kazooie try to stop her, they have to fight their way through her massive lair filled with worlds she has created to stop them and collect the jiggies to reach the top. As this did not stop the duo, she engaged them into a game show focusing on her and the levels, called "Grunty\'s Furnace Fun". Banjo and Kazooie succeeded, however, and won Tooty in the process. After that, she battled the two at the top of her tower but was once again defeated, thrown of the building and buried under a huge rock. After her henchman Klungo tried to free her for two months, he built a giant robot called Mecha-Grunty, for the witch to transfer her soul into and she kidnapped Kazooie and traveled back in time with her to prevent the duo from ever meeting, setting the events of Grunty\'s Revenge into motion. Banjo followed them and freed Kazooie and, although fighting them repeatedly throughout the worlds, she lost again in a battle in her lair, where her body was destroyed and she was sent back to present. After she was trapped under the rock again, she ordered Klungo to go get her sisters. After almost two years, her sisters finally arrive and free her from her tomb. However, she is now completely skeletonized. Mumbo witnesses her return and warns the others, so she blows up Banjo\'s house, killing Bottles. The three wreck havoc on the Isle o\' Hags with their new machine to suck out the life force out of others to restore her life again. Banjo and Kazooie again set out to defeat her, this time fighting through several worlds located on the island, finally confronting her in the Cauldron Keep. Again, she has prepared a quiz with her sisters as contestants, the "Tower of Tragedy Quiz". As her sisters lose; however, she kills them and confronts Banjo and Kazooie atop the tower with her giant drill-tank. Being defeated once again, she tries to kill them with a powerful spell, which however backfires and destroys all of her body except her skull. Being used as a football by Banjo and Kazooie\'s party, she vows revenge. It takes her skull eight years to crawl back to Spiral Mountain by the beginning of Nuts and Bolts, once again challenging Banjo and Kazooie for a final duel for the deed\'s of the land. The Lord of Games stops them, being annoyed by their constant rivalry and their pitiful performances. He offers them a true competition in a world he has created, Showdown Town. He restores the duo\'s fitness and grants Gruntilda a new body, as well as a new sidekick, Piddles. To make the competition more fair, he on the other hand takes away their moves and magic, respectively. Gruntilda studies mechanics and builds Gruntbots, mechanic minions to stop Banjo and Kazooie, as well as appearing in each world as a boss. In the final showdown in Spiral Mountain, she is again defeated and has to work in L.O.G.\'s video game fabric for an eternity, with Piddles being her supervisor, although she implies that it would have acted to her benefit anyways to create her own game. She also appears as a playable character in Banjo-Pilot. Klungo the Loyal Henchman (or \'"Minion with a Mission"\') is Gruntilda\'s minion for the first three games. He is a green familiar spirit/gruntling who creates machines and potions to aid Grunty in her schemes. He uses poor grammar when he speaks, and extends the letter S in words; for example, "Mistress" would become "Missstresss". Klungo first appears in Banjo-Kazooie where he was only seen in a few cutscenes, helping Grunty all the way. He created the machine that would transfer Tooty\'s beauty to Gruntilda, and is required to throw the switch to activate it. After Gruntilda is defeated, he tries to push the huge rock off her body. In Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty\'s Revenge, set two months later, he realizes that this is leading nowhere and builds a robotic host body for Grunty, in which she transfers her soul. After that, the two kidnap Kazooie and travel back in time to prevent their enemies from ever meeting. Klungo appears as a boss four times, using force shield and invisibility potions as well as ghosts. After Gruntilda is defeated, he is also sent back to the future, where he is advised by Grunty to get her sisters and tries to push of the rock in the meantime once again. After her sisters appear and free Grunty, the three wreck havoc on the Isle o\' Hags with the H.A.G. and the B.O.B. and Klungo follows them by foot. His role is expanded compared to the first game, as he appears as a boss three times, where he can turn himself invisible, into a giant and create copies of himself with the aid of potions. Each time he loses, he goes to Grunty to get himself punished and appears more battered from battle to battle. In the end, he quits aiding Gruntilda and joins Banjo\'s group, attending their party and eating all the pizza. As he leaves Cauldron Keep, he mutters about going off to make "ssstupid gamesss" In Nuts and Bolts, he indeed achieved that goal, as he runs an arcade in Showdown Town, where one can play his own game Hero Klungo Sssavesss Teh World. In the DLC "L.O.G.\'s Lost Challenges" he has also created a sequel, named Hero Klungo Sssavesss Teh Universsse. His injuries from Grunty\'s abuse are still present. He also appears as a playable character in Banjo-Pilot. Blobbelda and Mingella are the two younger witch sisters of Gruntilda. While Blobbelda is short and fat, Mingella is long and thin. The two arrive to rescue her in Banjo-Tooie, after Grunty orders Klungo to go get them after losing in Grunty\'s Revenge. They build a giant driller from the remains of her sister\'s robotic host body and free her from her tomb. The three wreck havoc on the Isle o\' Hags and use the B.O.B. to suck the life out of its inhabitants, killing Bottles. In the Cauldron Keep, the two are killed by Gruntilda after losing the "Tower of Tragedy Quiz" against Banjo and Kazooie. Piddles the Cat is introduced by L.O.G. as Gruntilda\'s new sidekick in Nuts and Bolts. Gruntilda initially refuses her and kicks her away but is in return attacked by Piddles. She aids Gruntilda by her schemes in some of the levels. In the final battle in Spiral Mountain, she and Gruntilda suffer a defeat and after that are forced to work in L.O.G.\'s video game factory, where Piddles acts as Grunty\'s supervisor. Tooty the Honey Bear is Banjo\'s younger sister and has always tried to convince him to go on an adventure with him. The day said adventure is set to start; however, she is kidnapped by Gruntilda, who wants to absorb her beauty. Her brother Banjo and his best friend Kazooie set out to rescue her. She is the first prize in "Grunty\'s Furnace Fun" and is saved by Banjo-Kazooie after their win. Brenthilda is one of the four Winkybunion sisters. Unlike her witch sisters, she acts as a fairy godmother and helps Banjo and Kazooie by telling them disgusting facts about Gruntilda, which help them succeed in Grunty\'s Furnace Fun. Captain Blubber is a sea hippo pirate. He first appears in Treasure Trove Cove in Banjo-Kazooie, where the duo needs to rescue his treasure from his shipwrecked ship, The Salty Hippo, because he cannot swim. In Grunty\'s Revenge, set 20 years before the first game, he appears as a child version of himself, referred to as Little Blubber. He challenges Banjo to a minigame. In Banjo-Tooie, his ship has sunk completely and he now runs an unsuccessful wave racer shop. In the end of the game, he is seen riding the UFO Saucer of Peril. By the time of Nuts and Bolts, where he appears in some worlds, he has crash-landed it in Showdown Town. Boggy the Polar Bear is an obese bear that loves sledding. He first appears as an opponent in Banjo-Kazooie\'s Freezeezy Peak, where he can be challenged for two races. In Banjo-Tooie, he and his family have moved to the icy side of Hailfire Peaks. As he is hungry but to lazy to leave TV, he offers Banjo and Kazooie a jiggy if they can bring him food. In Nuts and Bolts, he runs a small gym in Showdown Town, as his wife kicked him out to go work and appears in several worlds. Gobi the Camel is a camel found in several worlds in Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie. After they freed it in Gobi\'s Valley, the duo jumps on him to release his water safings in both the same world and Click Clock Wood in the first game, and they are done in the next game the same manner. For that, he carries a certain grudge for and fear from the two. While not appearing in Nuts and Bolts, he has two vehicles designed after him. King Jingaling is a yellow Jinjo who is the king of all Jinjos and the ruler of Jinjo Village. He is turned into a zombie in Banjo-Tooie, when the B.O.B. sucks his life force out of him. When hit, he gives the duo tips on how to defeat enemy bosses. After Banjo Kazooie complete the "Tower of Tragedy Quiz", they reverse the machine, giving him his life back. In Nuts and Bolts, he runs a bingo business in Showdown Town. While not appearing in Grunty\'s Revenge, there is a chopped off stone head in front of Grunty\'s castle, indicating that it might have been his. Master Jiggywiggy is the leader of a sect, dedicated to worshiping a giant crystal jiggy in their temple. As revealed in Grunty\'s Revenge, Gruntilda has cursed the jiggy priests, so that they cannot touch the jiggy\'s, thus relying on Banjo and Kazooie to collect them. When the duo has gathered enough jiggys, he allows them to use the crystal jiggy to open new worlds in Grunty\'s Revenge, while they have to complete a puzzle in Banjo-Tooie. While not appearing in Nuts and Bolts Jolly Dodger sells a jiggy named "Mr. Jiggywiggy", as his head is a jiggy. Honey B is a giant bee, selling additional honeycombs in her hive. She proclaims herself to be the "Mistress of the Honey"; however, she later confesses that she is merely an "Apprentice of the Honey" after the final honeycomb piece is redeemed. Jolly Roger is a frog and the mayor of the eponymous lagoon, in which he also runs a tavern. He asks the duo to go find his business partner for the approaching happy hour and rents them a room in which one of Jamjar\'s hatches is placed. In Nuts and Bolts, he is turned from mayor into a shady bootlegger who sells stolen jiggy\'s to Banjo and Kazooie and has changed his name to Jolly Dodger. He also appears in some of the game\'s worlds. He is a playable character in Banjo-Pilot. Mr. Fit the Aardvark is a sport-obsessed aardvark that premieres in Banjo-Tooie. He appears in Cloud Cuckooland, where he challenges Banjo and Kazooie to three sport contests. When succeeded, he awards the duo with a jiggy. He reappears in Nuts and Bolts, where he can be found in several worlds. Trophy Thomas the Cheetah is an overly competitive inhabitant of Showdown Town who also appears in several worlds of Nuts and Bolts. In every challenge of the game, he has set a certain requirement above those of a regular jiggy. If a duo meets said requirement, they are awards a T.T. Trophy, four of which equal a bonus jiggy he gives the player by his house in Showdown Town. Pikelet the Pig is the obese chief of the Showdown Town Police and enforces his laws in the city, although he can be bribed. He also appears in several worlds of Nuts and Bolts.'

aS'The Red Clay Ramblers are a North Carolina-based band founded in Durham, North Carolina, performing continuously since their formation in 1972. The current touring band has been together since 1987, with Jack Herrick (trumpet, bass), Bland Simpson (piano), Clay Buckner (fiddle), and Chris Frank (guitar). The original members included Tommy Thompson (banjo), Bill Hicks (fiddle) and Jim Watson (mandolin, bass). Mike Craver joined Red Clay Ramblers in 1973, and recorded with them on their first record, which was released by Folkways under the title The Red Clay Ramblers with Fiddlin\' Al McCanless. The quartet continued their recording career with Stolen Love on the Flying Fish label, recorded in 1974 and released in 1975 during their successful run in "Diamond Studs." Jack Herrick joined the band in 1976 as a bass and trumpet player. The band recorded, concertized and performed in theatrical productions, most notably Diamond Studs (Bland Simpson/Jim Wann) off-Broadway in 1975. Their 1977 recording, Merchants Lunch, described a trucker\'s disastrous visit to a Nashville diner. (The diner still exists at the same location, but has been renamed the "Merchant\'s Restaurant"). The recordings produced by the Red Clay Ramblers during their first decade include Stolen Love, Twisted Laurel, Merchants Lunch, Meeting in the Air, Chuckin\' the Frizz, and Hard Times, all on the Flying Fish label, and all available as CDs through Rounder Records. The first decade of the Ramblers also produced album-collaborations with other musicians, including Debby McClatchy in 1976 and Si Kahn in 1981. Chuckin\' the Frizz is noteworthy as a live album. Meeting is an album of all Carter Family songs featuring the singing of Tommy Thompson, Mike Craver, and Jim Watson. These early albums featured several writing collaborations by Mike Craver and Tommy Thompson, the most "famous" of which are "Merchants Lunch" and "The Ace." Debby McClatchy recorded Hicks\' most infamous original composition, "You Were Only F**king, While I Was Making Love." Fiddler Clay Buckner joined the band when fiddler Bill Hicks left the band in 1981. The Red Clay Ramblers continued to perform steadily, including an Off-Broadway production of Sam Shepard\'s Lie of the Mind in 1985-86. Following that production the personnel of the group changed, with Shawn Colvin and Bland Simpson replacing Watson and Craver. Colvin left the band August 1987, replaced by Chris Frank on guitar-accordion-tuba.

aS'A hidalgo (Spanish:[ialo]) or fidalgo (Portuguese:[fiau], Galician:[fialo]) is a member of the Spanish and Portuguese nobility. In popular usage it has come to mean the non-titled nobility. Hidalgos were exempt from paying taxes, but did not necessarily own real property. The feminine is hidalga in Spanish and fidalga in Portuguese and Galician. Since at least the twelfth century, the words fijo d\'algo (often literally translated as "son of something"), or its common contraction, fidalgo, was used in the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal to refer to the nobility. In Portugal the cognate remained fidalgo, although these "nobles" had a somewhat different status from the Spanish hidalgos. In the Kingdom of Aragon, the counterpart of the Castilian hidalgos were called infanzones (singular: infanzn). With the changes in Spanish pronunciation that occurred in the late Middle Ages, the sound represented by the letter f was lost, giving rise to the modern pronunciation and spelling, hidalgo.[1] (see History of the Spanish language). Although the word algo generally means "something", in this expression, the word specifically denotes "riches" or "wealth"; therefore, it was originally a synonym of "noble" or ricohombre (literally a "rich man") in the Spanish of the period. With time, it colloquially came to mean the lower-ranking gentry (the untitled, lower strata of the nobility who were exempt from paying taxes). The Leyes de Partidas, assert that the word originally derives from itlico, that is, a man with full Roman citizenship, but this is discounted by modern etymologists and historians. There is no evidence for another popular folk etymology that the term is a corruption for hijo de godo[2][3] However, all nobles whatever the titles that became more numerous only after the 1200s, were called in the Kingdoms of Leon, Galicia, Portugal and Castile as Godos (Goths) and as descendants of those from the Kingdom of Toledo, and still is in common use in some regions but where it has a pejorative connotation from the lower rural folk point of view.[4] The condition of "nobles" as freemen without land wealth, but with the rights to wear arms and be exempted from paying taxes in compensation to their military service on call, was known among the previous Visigoths states. It was still in force by the law Fuero Juzgo. The Goths used the term as well the term Vesi, the "good men". The hidalgo byname from it, "sons of the good ones" was used alternatively with the toponymical other, "sons of La Montaa" as a continued instance of its use and meaning in Old Castile. The hidalgua has its origins in fighting men of the Reconquista. By the tenth century the term infanzn appears in Asturian-Leonese documents as a synonym for the Spanish and Medieval Latin terms caballero and miles (both, "knight"). These infanzones were vassals of the great magnates and prelates and ran their estates for them as petty nobility. In these first centuries it was still possible to become a miles simply by being able to provide, and afford the costs of, mounted military service. Only by the mid-twelfth century did the ranks of the knights begin to bein theoryclosed by lineage. In the frontier towns that were created as the Christian kingdoms pushed into Muslim land, the caballeros, and not the magnates who often were far away, came to dominate politics, society and cultural patronage. From their ranks were also drawn the representatives of the towns and cities when the cortes were convened by kings. It was in the twelfth century that this class, along with the upper nobility, began to be referred to as hidalgos.[5] Hidalgos de sangre (by virtue of lineage) are "those for whom there is no memory of its origin and there is no knowledge of any document mentioning a royal grant, which obscurity is universally praised even more than those noblemen who know otherwise their origin", or in other words, an immemorial noble.[6] When challenged, an hidalgo de sangre may obtain a judicial sentence validating his nobility from the Royal Chancillera of Valladolid or Granada, if he can prove that it has been accepted local society and custom. In this case, the resulting legal document that verifies his nobility is called a carta ejecutoria de hidalguia (letters patent of nobility).[7][8] To qualify as an hidalgo solariego ("ancestral hidalgo"), one had to prove that all four of one\'s grandparents were hidalgos. Hidalgos solariegos were regarded as the most noble and treated with the most respect. One could also receive the title as a reward for meritorious acts, or by joining an hermandad. The natives of Biscay were all born hidalgos, giving them access to military and administrative careers. Unlike other hidalgos who refused manual work as contrary to their honour (as seen in Lazarillo de Tormes), Biscayne universal gentry extended to the lowliest native worker. Hidalgo de bragueta[9] ("fly-of-the-trousers hidalgo") obtained tax exemption for having seven sons in legal matrimony. In Asturias, Cantabria and other regions of Spain every seven years the King ordered the creation of padrones ("registers") where the population was classified either as hidalgos nobles, and therefore, exempt from taxation due to their military status or pecheros (from an archaic verb, pechar, "to pay")[10] who composed the estado llano ("lower ranks") and were excluded from military service and had to pay taxes. These padrones constitute nowadays a rich source of information about population genealogy and distribution as well as proof of nobility in certain cases. Over the years the title lost its significance, especially in Spain. Kings routinely awarded the title in exchange for personal favors. By the time of the reign of the House of Bourbon, over half a million people enjoyed tax exemptions, putting tremendous strain on the royal state which wasn\'t calling their services to arms but relied more in professional armies and costly mercenaries. Attempts were made to reform the title and by the early nineteenth century with the forced levies to military service of all citizens by Universal Conscription without any minimum requirements of nobility or pay or loyalty by honour but by coercion on desertion, it had entirely disappeared, along with the social class it had originally signified and most of its centuries old developed code of honour in the nation social culture. By some twist of policies but agenda clearly copied from the French state, all hidalgos have been lumped with pecheros (taxable payers) but all citizens have not become hidalgos by any stretch of social rights or privileges but were still forced to pay in both, taxes and blood risks. Both social estates of the realm have become undivided and forced to add to the nation contributions in both manners without exemption, while the titled nobility and royalty kept their former privileges and exemptions. In literature the hidalgo is usually portrayed as a noble who has lost nearly all of his family\'s wealth but still held on to the privileges and honours of the nobility. The prototypical fictional hidalgo is Don Quixote, who was given the sobriquet \'the Ingenious Hidalgo\' by his creator, Miguel de Cervantes. In the novel Cervantes has Don Quixote satirically present himself as an hidalgo de sangre and aspire to live the life of a knight-errant despite the fact that his economic position does not allow him to truly do so.[11] Don Quixote\'s possessions allowed to him a meager life devoted to his reading obsession, yet his concept of honour led him to emulate the knights-errant.'

aS'Source: https://www.ntpc.co.in/ Badarpur Thermal Power Station is located at Badarpur area in NCT Delhi. The power plant is one of the coal based power plants of NTPC. The National Power Training Institute (NPTI) for North India Region under Ministry of Power, Government of India was established at Badarpur in 1974, within the Badarpur Thermal power plant (BTPS) complex.[1] The Badarpur Thermal Power Station has an installed capacity of 705 MW. It is situated in south east corner of Delhi on Mathura Road near Faridabad. It was the first central sector power plant conceived in India, in 1965. It was originally conceived to provide power to neighbouring states of Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, U.P., Rajasthan, and Delhi. But since year 1987 Delhi has become its sole beneficiary. It was owned and conceived by Central Electric Authority. Its construction was started in year 1968, and the First unit was commissioned in 26 July 1973. The coal for the plant is derived from the Jharia Coal Fields. This was constructed under ownership of Central Electric Authority, later it was transferred to NTPC. It supplies power to Delhi city. It is one of the oldest plant in operation. Its 100 MW units capacity have been reduced to 95 MW. These units have indirectly fired boiler, while 210 MW units have directly fired boiler. All the turbines are of Russian Design. Both turbine and boilers have been supplied by BHEL. The boiler of Stage-I units are of Czech. design. The boilers of Unit 4 and 5 are designed by combustion engineering (USA). The instrumentation of the stage I units and unit 4 are of The Russian design. Instrumentation of unit5 is provided by M/S Instrumentation Ltd. Kota, is of Kent design. In 1978 the management of the plant was transferred to NTPC, from CEA. The performance of the plant increased significantly, and steadily after take over by NTPC till 2006, but now the plant is facing various issues. Being an old plant, Badarpur Thermal Power Station (BTPS) has little automation. Its performance is deteriorating due to various reasons, like aging, poor quantity and quality of cooling water etc. It receive cooling water from Agra Canal, which is an irrigation canal from Yamuna river. Due to rising water pollution, the water of Yamuna is highly polluted. This polluted water when goes into condenser, adversely affect life of condenser tubes, resulting in frequent tube leakages. This dirty water from tube leakages, gets mixed into feed water cycle causes numerous problems, like frequent boiler tube leakages, and silica deposition on turbine blades. Apart from poor quality, the quantity of water supply is also erratic due to lack of co-ordination between NTPC and UP irrigation which manages Agra Canal. The quality of the coal supplied has degraded considerably. At worst times, there were many unit tripping owing to poor quality. The poor coal quality also put burdens on equipment, like mills and their performance also goes down.The coal for the plant is fetched from far away, that makes the total fuel cost double of coal cost at coalmine. This factor, coupled with low efficiency due to aging and old design makes electricity of the plant costlier. Presently the management is headed by Mr. N. K. Kothari, General manager.[2] '

aS'Gas Street Studios also known as The Birmingham Studios is a studio complex operated by ITV plc in Birmingham, England. The complex is currently only used by ITV Central for the broadcast of ITV News Central and much of the complex has been sold off for other uses. The complex had also previously been used for other broadcasts including the former home of CITV. In 1994, the Central\'s new owners Carlton Communications acquired land on Gas Street, Birmingham, to begin work on building a new digital studio complex, with the intention of replacing Central\'s Broad Street studios. The new centre was completed in 1997, when Central West\'s regional news department moved from its Broad Street base. A tribute to the Broad Street studios was broadcast on Central News West.[2] The studios were originally designed to have the "Central Cake" logo but the original branding of the studios was the Carlton logo, this was used until 2004. When Carlton merged with Granada it featured ITV Central branding which was updated in 2006 when the new ITV logo came into use. The complex was used for the in vision continuity links for CITV until this was moved to Granada Studios in Manchester in 2004. From its opening until 2005 it was where ITV Central continuity was handled which was the last to stop being produced locally after ITV switched to national continuity in 2002 which was broadcast from Chiswick. Gas Street studios also housed the Central playout until October 2004 when ITV plc closed Central\'s presentation/transmission department and moved the transmission to the Northern Transmission Centre in Leeds. All networked programming for the ITV network from Gas Street ceased in 2005 leaving only the ITV News Central production from the studios.[3] Central News East was moved to the studios on 5th February 2005 following the closure of Carlton Studios in Nottingham. The East Midlands version of Central News was then presented from Studio E at Gas street until 23 February 2009 when the both regions started using the same programme. The only programme currently broadcast from the studios is ITV Central news programme ITV News Central. The national ITV plc feedback service (ITV viewer services) is also based at the complex. ITV have since also sold the Gas Street office building to Cube Real Estate, a commercial property developer, which has refurbished the interior of the building. While Central maintains office space and a single ground floor studio, the other studio and floors are available to rent as office space. The property is marketed as 22 Gas Street.[4]'

aS"Obert Clark Tanner (September 20, 1904  October 14, 1993) was a University of Utah professor of philosophy, philanthropist, and founder of O.C. Tanner Co.[1] Tanner was born in Farmington, Utah to Joseph Marion Tanner and Annie Vilate Clark. His mother was Tanner's second wife, and they spent their wedding night apart because of the Federal government opposition to polygamy. O.C. Tanner was the youngest of Annie's 10 children, and he would later publish her memoirs as A Mormon Mother: An Autobiography by Annie Clark Tanner. It details how his father, exiled to Canada because of his practice of polygamy, was a fading presence in the life of his son. Annie struggled to survive financially, and O.C. felt a responsibility to contribute financially from an early age, doing odd jobs that included stoking furnaces at the university to pay his tuition.

His songs have been heard on the Grammy-nominated "Healthy Food For Thought" compilation as well as MTV Cribs and the movie "Dead Broke" (Warner Bros) featuring Paul Sorvino. He has performed as an actor and singer in touring companies of Broadway musicals, including Jesus Christ Superstar, Jekyll & Hyde, and The Who\'s Tommy. In 2005, the off-Broadway production Moonlight Interior, a musical based on Klose\'s music, premiered in New York City.

At this time he began teaching himself the keyboard and subsequently guitar as well as singing and dancing in the high school show choir. He returned to Hamburg, Germany to finish Gymnasium (high school) and started playing out, first in subway stations, the high school\'s band and then local clubs in Hamburg\'s Reeperbahn red-light district.

Annie had heard Klose perform at the CD release party for Serenity House (East Coast Recording Co.) which also included works by Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull), Pat DiNizio (The Smithereens), Robert Hazard and Kathy Sledge (Sister Sledge). In 2009 he opened for Renaissance on their 40th anniversary reunion tour at performing arts centers and theaters in the Northeast U.S., including The Concert Hall, The Keswick Theatre and The Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.[2][3] Jann performed at Martin Guitar\'s 175th Anniversary concert with Marty Stuart, Roger McGuinn, and Rosanne Cash and has toured extensively with rock troubadour Elliott Murphy, whose band The Normandy All Stars backed him at a show in Le Havre, France in 2009.

The Black Abbott was once a monk of Dakoth-Kuru, a sect that had managed to use their teachings to unlock the full potential of their minds, giving them incredible mental powers. The Black Abbot had more powers, the ability to control the twelve others and took control of the entire brotherhood. Spider-Man and the Human Torch defeated one of his apostles pretending to be the Black Abbott, and then Spider-Man and Thor defeated the true Black Abbott.[1] A Scourge of the Underworld working for the Red Skull later reported to his leader that the Black Abbott was among his successful kills.[2] The Black Abbott was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher.[3] He battles the Punisher while posing as a member of the Avengers. He is badly injured when a bomb meant to kill the villains explodes; Letha orders Bird-Man to take him to safety.[4] The Black Abbott possesses many mental abilities, including telepathy, low-range mental control, psychic blasts and telekinesis. He can control many subjects at once, and in the process, they act as near-duplicates of him, in speech and thinking.

aS'Leland Palmer is a fictional character from the television series Twin Peaks, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost. He also appears in the prequel, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.[1] Leland (played by Ray Wise) is an attorney, with his primary client being local businessman Ben Horne. He is well-known and respected in the town of Twin Peaks. Together with his wife Sarah and his daughter Laura, his family seems to be perfect. When Laura is murdered, Lelands psychological foundations begin to crumble. He experiences multiple nervous breakdowns and during Laura\'s funeral flings himself into her grave and must be pulled out. He remains unstable for some time. When Jacques Renault is arrested as a suspect for the murder of Laura, Leland loses control and murders Jacques. After killing Jacques, Leland\'s hair suddenly turns white. Leland is arrested, but released (without bail) pending trial due to personal assurances made by Sheriff Harry S. Truman that he does not pose any danger to the community. Leland\'s behavior at times appears normal but he behaves manically happy at times before crashing into grief. The arrival of his niece, Madeleine Ferguson, who looks almost exactly like Laura (both roles are played by Sheryl Lee), is of great help to him in learning how to deal with his daughters death. It is eventually revealed that, as a boy, Leland met a strange neighbor who turned out to be a demonic entity named BOB, who would possess him throughout his life. (It is also implied that BOB molested him as a child.) As an adult, Leland molests and rapes Laura throughout her teens, all the while controlled by BOB. It is difficult to tell while watching the series when Leland is truly in control of himself and when he is being possessed by BOB. It is implied that Leland killed Jacques Renault on his own  not under BOB\'s control  and that Leland is lost from that point: he is no longer able to stop BOB and is completely taken over (physically manifested by the change of hair color and a dramatic change in behavior). The changes from this point help Cooper to finally identify him as BOB\'s "host". Leland is eventually exposed as the murderer of both his daughter and his niece, and arrested by FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper and Sheriff Harry Truman. He dies in custody following his bizarre interrogation on the night of his arrest. BOB takes control of Leland and forces him to run headfirst into the wall of an interrogation room. At the moment of his death, Leland remembers the crimes he committed under BOB\'s control. After Cooper recites the last rites from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Leland sees a vision of his daughter Laura and dies. Cooper explains to the widowed Sarah in the following episode, it was probably Laura forgiving him and welcoming him into the afterlife. In the final episode of the series, Cooper encounters a grinning doppelgnger of Leland in the Black Lodge, who says, "I did not kill anybody."'

For most of the year Roeper was posting print reviews and blog entries. In December 2009, he launched a video section, with on-camera reviews of movies. The video segments are produced in partnership with the Starz premium cable channel. Roeper announced the reviews will appear first on his site, then on the Starz channel.[citation needed] In December 2009, it was reported[by whom?] that Roeper had signed a "six-figure" deal with ReelzChannel to be a regular contributor.

aS"Somalia Garowe (Somali: Garoowe, Arabic: ) is the administrative capital of the autonomous Puntland region in northeastern Somalia. The area was ruled in the 19th century by the Majeerteen Sultanate. It would later be incorporated into Italian Somaliland. Garowe is located in the Nugal province, and is the seat of the regional parliament, the presidential palace and government ministries. A fast-growing city, it has also evolved into a local media and cultural hub. During the 19th century, Garowe and much of northeastern Somalia were an integral part of the Majeerteen Sultanate, ruled by Boqor Osman Mahamud, cousin of Sultan Yusuf Ali Kenadid of the Sultanate of Hobyo. The city would later be incorporated into Italian Somaliland during the colonial period. Following independence, Garowe was made a district center of Bosaso. The city would subsequently be re-assigned in the early 1970s as the regional capital of an area consisting of Las Anod and Eyl. Straddling the Nugal valley, this new administrative division would be named Nugal.[1] Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, a homegrown constitutional conference was held in Garowe in 1998 over a period of three months. Attended by the area's political elite, traditional elders (Issims), members of the business community, intellectuals and other civil society representatives, the autonomous Puntland State of Somalia was subsequently officially established so as to deliver services to the population, offer security, facilitate trade, and interact with both domestic and international partners.[2] Garowe is situated in northeastern Somalia, in the heart of the Puntland region. Nearby settlements include to the east Gillab (4.8 nm), to the northeast Qalqalooc (15.3 nm), to the north Libaax Seexay (2.5 nm), to the northwest Geida Debabo (12.2), to the west Bixin (5.9 nm), to the southwest Lugo (6.0 nm), to the south Salaxley (5.3 nm), and to the southeast War Weytan (9.7 nm).[3][4] The largest cities in the country most proximate to Garowe are Qardho (205 km),[5] Galkayo (216 km) and Erigavo (275 km).[6] Shimbiris, the highest peak in Somalia, is located some 293 km to the northwest in the Cal Madow mountain range.[6] The climate in Garowe is generally hot and dry. Coldest average temperatures occur during the winter months of November to February, when thermometer readings range from 23 to 25 C (73to 77F). The weather slowly heats up in the spring, as the April rainy season begins. Average temperatures later reach a maximum of around 41 C over the summer period. Come September, a gradual fall chill starts to set in again.[7] Garowe is the third largest city in Puntland after Bosaso and Galkayo. Situated in the Nugal province in the geographical center of the region, it is the seat of the regional parliament, the presidential palace and government ministries. The municipal administration is currently led by Abdiaziz Nur Elmi Koor. He was appointed Mayor in September 2009.[8] On November 19, 2012, a ceremony was held in one of Garowe's government districts to mark the opening of the new local Corrections Academy and Headquarters. The event was inaugurated by Puntland President Abdirahman Mohamud Farole and Vice President Abdisamad Ali Shire, along with a UNODC delegation. A multi-tiered security complex, the compound features classrooms, staff quarters and offices. A new bureau for the Puntland Ministry of Justice and Rehabilitation was also opened. Additionally, the officials laid down the foundation for a new prison facility that is being constructed in the city.[9] They later did the same in January 2013 for a new Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports office. The area also features the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Health buildings, as well as the Puntland State House.[10] Additionally, a new presidential palace was opened on April 16, 2013.[11] Garowe has a total population of about 57,300 inhabitants.[12] As with most of Puntland, it is primarily inhabited by Somalis from the Harti Darod clan confederation, particularly the Majeerteen.[13] Garowe has a number of academic institutions. According to the Puntland Ministry of Education, there are 30 primary schools in the Garowe District. Among these are Alxikma, Mayle, Wabari and Darwiish, named after Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's Dervish State.[14] Secondary schools in the area include Alwaha, Gambol, Nawawi and Nugal High.[15] Puntland State University's main campus is also located here. The school grew out of the Garowe School of Management, a women's college in Garowe offering courses in business management, accounting, computer skills and business English. Following the graduation of 60 pupils in its inaugural year, the school was expanded to observe a two-year structure and renamed the Puntland Community College (PCC). In 2004, the PCC again expanded its syllabus, this time offering four-year programs; it was also renamed to Puntland State University (PSU).[16] Other institutions of higher learning in the city include the Garowe Teachers Education College (GTEC), a primary teachers' training center that caters to the larger region. East Africa University (EAU) also has a Garowe branch, one of its six campuses in Puntland.[17] A number of NGOs also have their main offices in the city, including the local Puntland Development Research Center (PDRC). The PDRC plays a key role in research and funding for the development of peace and effective governance initiatives in Puntland. Additionally, the Puntland Agency For Social Welfare (PASWE) is headquartered here. Founded in May 2009 by the regional administration, it provides medical, educational and counseling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of religious scholars (ulema), businesspeople, intellectuals and traditional elders.[18] Garowe is served by one major medical institution, Garowe Regional Hospital, in addition to numerous smaller health clinics. In 2008, the foundations were laid for the construction of a new general hospital, built with assistance from the Somali Manhal agency.[19] The following year, a local non-profit organization also established the region's first mental health facility.[18] On April 22, 2013, the Puntland Ministery of Fisheries and Marine Resources officially inaugurated a new fish market in Garowe. Constructed in conjunction with the UK authorities and the UNDP, it is part of a larger regional development plan which will see two other similar marketplaces launched within the year in Galkayo and Qardho.[20] Garowe is transversed by a 750 km north-south highway. It connects major cities in the northern part of the country, such as Bosaso and Galkayo, with towns in the south.[21] In 2012, the Puntland Highway Authority completed rehabilitation work on the central artery linking Garowe with Galkayo.[22] The transportation body also began an upgrade and repair project in June 2012 on the large thoroughfare between the city and Bosaso. Additionally, plans are in the works to construct new roads connecting littoral towns in the region to the main highway.[23] Local air transport needs are served by Garowe International Airport, a major new airport situated about 12 km from the city center. It was officially opened in 2010 under the aegis of the Ministry for Civil Aviation and Airports. The first phase of the airport's construction was completed through a public-private partnership over a period of seven years, with the Garowe-based Mubarak construction company having assisted significantly in completing the project. The airport also attempts to adhere to the air transport standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).[24] Garowe is home to Mire Aware Stadium, a sporting facility with a crowd capacity of over 15,000 spectators. In 2010, it hosted the Somali National Football Tournament, the first nation-wide football competition held since 1987 and the ensuing outbreak of the civil war. Organized by the Puntland administration in conjunction with the Somali Football Federation, the tournament also marked the first time that the event was held outside of Mogadishu.[25] Various media organizations are based in Garowe. The latter include Radio Garowe, the sister outlet to Garowe Online. In May 2013, the broadcaster launched an additional FM station in Bosaso.[26] Radio Daljir, Puntland's largest radio station, also has a studio in Garowe, with its main heaquarters in Bosaso.[27] The broadcaster's network of 7 FM transmitters reaches most of Puntland as well as part of the neighboring Galmudug region to the south. Additionally, Garowe has various places of accommodation. Among these hotels and guest houses is the Meka Hotel, situated downtown. Garowe is subdived into several administrative districts:"

aS"The Automotive industry has been an active and growing field in Pakistan for a long time, however not as much established to figure in the prominent list of the top automotive industries, having astable annual production 100-170 thousands only. Despite significant production volumes, transfer of technology and localization of vehicle components remains low, and only a few car models are assembled in the country while customers have a very small variety of vehicles to choose from. The lack of competition in the local auto industry due to the presence of just three assemblers -and only one small car assembler- has resulted in technological stagnation of the industry; small cars produced by Paksuzuki, the country's largest auto assembler, in the country are globally retired models utilizing obsolete technology and not offering any safety features. Currently some of the major world automakers have set up assembly plants or are in joint ventures with local companies these include Toyota, General motors Honda, Suzuki, Nissan Motors. The total contribution of Auto industry to GDP in 2007 was 2.8% which is likely to increase up to 5.6% in the next 5years. Auto sector presently, contributes 16% to the manufacturing sector which is predicted to increase 25% in the next 7years. Many cars in the country have dual fuel options and run on CNG which is more affordable and cheaper than petrol in the country. According to Ministry of Industries, Pakistan produced its first vehicle in 1953, at the National Motors Limited, established in Karachi to assemble Bedford Trucks. Subsequently buses, light trucks and cars were assembled in the same plant. The industry was highly regulated until the early 1990s. After deregulation major Japanese manufacturers entered in the market thereby creating some competition in this sector. Assemblers of HINO Trucks, Suzuki Cars (1984), Mazda Trucks, Toyota (1993) and Honda (1994) in particular, entered once deregulation was introduced. Assembly of Daihatsu and Hyundai cars (1999) and various brands of LCVs and range of mini-trucks commenced recently. From 1953 to 2011, the journey of auto industry has been rough, tough and sometime very smooth. Car industry saw boom in 2006-2007 when sales touched record peak of 180,834 thanks to rising car financing up to 70-80 per cent by banks due to low interest rates and rising rural buying. Since then the industry has been surviving hard to reach the same sales level amid high interest rates and Yen appreciation against the rupee but high farm income is giving much support to car sales. Good crops this year will keep the car sales brisk despite increase in prices. The car industry has invested over Rs 20 billion in the last four to five years to meet growing demand. The direct employment in car industry hovers between 5,500-6,000 persons.Motorcycle production hit the country's record level of over 1.5 million units in 2010-2011 by the effort of Pervaiz Musharraf Government's decision that opened bike market to low cost Chinese bikes. Auto sector now employs 192,000 people directly and around 1.2 million indirectly and has Rs 98 billion of investments and contributes Rs 63 billion as indirect tax in the national exchequer. Auto Sector remains the second largest payer of indirect taxes after the Petroleum Sector. In Pakistan's context there are 10 cars in 1,000 persons which is one of the lowest in the emerging economies which itself speaks of high potential of growth in the auto sector and more so in the car production. Rising per capita income with changing demographic distribution and an anticipated influx of 30 to 40 million young people in the economically active workforce in the next few years provides a stimulus to the industry to expand and grow (Source AUTOMARK Magazine). There has also been a recent interest towards hybrid and electric cars among educated Pakistani buyers however there unavailability remains a problem."

aS'Mediastinoscopy is a procedure that enables visualization of the contents of the mediastinum, usually for the purpose of obtaining a biopsy.[1] Mediastinoscopy is often used for staging of lymph nodes of lung cancer or for diagnosing other conditions affecting structures in the mediastinum such as sarcoidosis or lymphoma. Mediastinoscopy involves making an incision approximately 1cm above the suprasternal notch of the sternum, or breast bone. Dissection is carried out down to the pretracheal space and down to the carina. A scope (mediastinoscope) is then advanced into the created tunnel which provides a view of the mediastinum. The scope may provide direct visualization or may be attached to a video monitor. Mediastinoscopy provides access to mediastinal lymph node levels 2, 4, and 7. Extended mediastinoscopy is a technique which allows access to the pre-aortic (station 6) and aortopulmonary window (station 5) lymph nodes. Parasternal mediastinotomy, aka, a Chamberlain procedure, is the standard approach to access lymph nodes at stations 5 and 6.

aS'Indcar is the trading name of Industrial Carrocera Arbuciense SA, a Spanish-based coachbuilder, specialized in building mini- and midibus bodies mainly on Mercedes-Benz and Iveco vans and truck chassis (although vans from other manufacturers are sometimes also used). Their products are sold throughout all of Western Europe. The company was established in 1888 by Mr. Francesc Queralt Roca in Arbcies, a village in the Selva county of the province of Girona, Catalonia, Spain. This small town offered the advantage of being in the midst of a densely forested area ("Selva" means "forest" in Catalan), useful since the bodyworks were made of wood at the time. It was the first of several cochbuilders to be based in Arbcies; it would be later followed by Ayats, Beulas, Noge and Boari. '
